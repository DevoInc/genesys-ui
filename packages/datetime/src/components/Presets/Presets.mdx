# Presets

Component used to display a list of presets intended to be used on date ranges
that can be selected by the user. The preset date ranges can be organized into
groups, with each group having a label.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Presets } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-datetime';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## How to use

The Presets component accepts a prop called `presets` shaped as an array of
objects that defines the list of preset ranges that are displayed. The value is
an array of `number | string | Date`.

The list can be either a one-level structure:

<Source code={`
[
  { value: [1, 2], label: 'Range 1' },
  { value: [2, 3], label: 'Range 2' },
],
`} />

Or multi-level if groups are required:

<Source code={`
[
  { label: 'Group 1' },
  { value: [1, 2], label: 'Range 1' },
  { value: [2, 3], label: 'Range 2' },
  { label: 'Group 2' },
  { value: [3, 4], label: 'Range 3' },
]
`} />

The Presets component also accepts a prop called `value` which is an array of
`number | string | Date` representing the currently selected value.

The value is checked for mark as selected one of the options following the next
rules:

- `Date` JS native object is converted to number using `.getTime()`.
- `Date` and `number` could be compared between them using the previous rule.
- `string` can't be compared to `Date` or `number`, so if you would like to use
a list of presets using string representation for the dates, use in the options
the value array as dates using any parser (for example the one from `date-fns`:
[parse](https://date-fns.org/v4.1.0/docs/parse)).

## Defaults

There is a default presets list that you can use with the next function:

<Source code={`import { getDefaultPresets } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-datetime';`} />

That is composed of other two functions:

- `getDefaultRelativeRanges`
- `getDefaultSnapRanges`

So you can do as in the next example

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

Also here you can see in action the prop `maxMenuHeight`.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
