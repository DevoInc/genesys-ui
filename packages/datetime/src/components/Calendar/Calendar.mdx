# Calendar

The Calendar is a component designed to work with `(number | Date)[]` that
could be a timestamp in millis or a js native Date, **always in UTC**.

It allows users to select a single date or a range of dates within a particular
month.

The calendar displays the days of the month in a grid format.

The Calendar use `date-fns` internally for date operations.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Calendar } from '@devo/genesys-ui-datetime';`} />

## Basic usage

The Calendar has several main concepts as props:

- `value`: Array of dates (Date | number), that create the both versions
  of Calendar one for a single day, two for a range.
- `monthDate`: This is the date for the month that is showed (could be different
  from the selected dates).

This is an example of range selected dates:

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

This is an example of single selected date:

<Canvas of={Stories.Single} />

## Disable days

For disable days we can use two mechanism:

### `minDate` and `maxDate`

Are properties that let us define limits for the selectable days

<Canvas of={Stories.MinMaxDate} />

### `parseDate`

Is a function that resolve into a parse result object, that take each calendar
day and use this function to know if the day is available or not. An example
could be:

<Source language="tsx" code={`
export const parseDateNoFuture = (dt: Date | number): IParseResult => {
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  const ts = getTime(dt); // Function for get epoch ts from dt
  const isValid = ts <= now;
  return {
    isValid: isValid,
    value: dt,
    errors: isValid ? [] : ['Date is invalid'],
  };
};
`} />

Lets see another example with a `parseDate` that avoid the even days and the
weekend days:

<Canvas of={Stories.ParseDate} />

### `disabled`

Is property for disable all the calendar

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Events

This component has one main event:

- `onClick`: when the user click on any selectable day

<Source language="tsx" code={`
...
onClick: (ts: number) => {
  // Here you can update the Calendar value with a state for example
  setValue(ts);
  // And let you build any pre-filter or advanced mechanism before update the
  // calendar
},
...
`} />

## I18n

We can use the next props for internationalization:

- `weekDays`: array of week days for the header, staring on Sunday
- `weekStart`: number of the week day that would be the first (0 - Sunday, 1 -
  Monday)
- `i18.outOfRange`: text for the tooltip that is shown when the user hover a day
that are out of range using the `minDate` or the `maxDate`

Here is an example of the *Spanish* calendar version:

<Canvas of={Stories.I18n} />

## Hooks

These hooks helps to apply the two main line of action with the calendar, the
single selection or the range selection.

### `useCalendarSingle`

Defines a single day selection in the calendar.
Accepts a `number` or `Date` with the selected day.

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleHook} />

### `useCalendarRange`

Defines a way to select a range of days. The hook use the first click as one
point of the range (could be the start or the end), and a second click with the
other point of the range, with this last point the hook decide with point is the
start and witch point is the end of the range

<Canvas of={Stories.RangeHook} />

## `rangeBehavior` helper

If you would like to build your own hooks you can use the main behavior of the
`useCalendarRange`, this is the next helper function:

<Source code={`import { rangeBehavior } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-datetime';

...
const newRange = rangeBehavior(
  [
    from: number | Date,
    to: number | Date
  ],
  newDate: number | Date,
);
...
`} />

This function take a range (empty, incomplete or complete), a new date and
return the next step of the range:

- If empty range is passed the function returns the incomplete range with a
single point
- If incomplete range is passed (only one point), the function returns a
complete range with the two points ordered in ascendant mode
- If complete range is passed, the function returns a new incomplete range with
a single point

## Timezone

The representation of each day, the start of the month, and the start of the
week is calculated using the browser guessed timezone, but if you need to set an
alternative timezone, you could use the prop `tz`

<Canvas of={Stories.Timezone} />
