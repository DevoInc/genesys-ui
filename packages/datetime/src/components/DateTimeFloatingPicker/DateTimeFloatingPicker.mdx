# DateTimeFloatingPicker

The DateTimeFloatingPicker is an extension of the DateTime component.
It renders a date type input that shows the aforementioned DateTime component when clicked, allowing users to select
a date and time in several ways.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`import { DateTimeFloatingPicker } from '@devo/genesys-ui-datetime';`}
/>

## Basic usage

Usually you have to use a state to control the date, based on an initial one from the value prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## With apply and cancel buttons

This way you need to execute the `onApply` prop to save the changes, so you need one more state to define the initial
date which will be used as the reset value if you cancel or close the popover.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithButtons} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
