# DateTimeRangeControl

Component used for selecting a range of date-time values.
The component provides options for specifying the format of the range,
including real-time control and shift modifiers.
The component also allows for the specification of labels and status messages to provide additional information and feedback to the user.

Each time the input text field value is modified, it undergoes validation
against accepted date formats.
The first value in the `dateFormats` array serves as the default value to display.
If no format is specified, the default value will be `YYYY-mm-dd HH:mm:ss`.

When the `Enter` key is pressed or when focus is lost and the value of the input
is valid, the `onChange` method of the component is triggered,
and the internal value is set to the new one.

When the `Escape` key is pressed the value is retored to last valid setted value.
