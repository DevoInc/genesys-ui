# FieldsCombiner

## Overview

Component used to create complex form block layouts by combining different types of form fields in a single row.

It provides customization options through props to control the appearance and behavior of the combined fields.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## How to import

<Source code={`import { FieldsCombiner } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-form';`} />

## Basic usage

There are a pre-defined components to be used as `FieldsCombiner` pieces. You should not
use another kind of component to do that, and you only are able to combine two of them.
These components are wrappers of the form ones to apply custom styles and behavior,
so the visual integration is as accurate as possible:

- `FieldsCombiner.Input`: it's the wrapper for the `InputControl.Input` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Select`: it's the wrapper for the `SelectControl` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Button`: it's the wrapper for the `Button` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.IconButton`: it's the wrapper for the `IconButton` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Checkbox`: it's the wrapper for the `CheckboxControl` component.

These components allow to add custom styles and some layout props as `width` to the
original components.

## Cases

There are multiple combinations of the form fields, but these are the most usual.

### Button and Popover

When we add a Popover as a piece of the `FieldsCombiner` we only have to use
the `FieldsCombiner.Button` or `FieldsCombiner.IconButton` as the trigger:

<Canvas of={CasesStories.ButtonAndPopover} />

### Input and Button or IconButton

By default, the field fills all the space available and the button only the necessary.
Anyway, you can use the `width` prop available in every pre-defined child component.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.InputAndButton} />

<Canvas of={CasesStories.InputAndIconButton} />

### Select and Input with custom widths

By default, the fields fill all the space available, but you can use the `width` prop
available in every pre-defined child component to distribute them in a custom way.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.CustomWidths} />

### Validation

You only have to add the desired validation status to the `FieldsCombiner` component and
its children will inherit it automatically. In addition, for accessibility reasons
you always have to add a validation message by the `helper` prop.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.WithValidation} />

## Props
