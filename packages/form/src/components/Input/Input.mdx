The Input component provides a way for users to enter free-form text data. It provides a range of customization
options to control the appearance and behavior of the switch,
as well as additional props for accessibility and guidance.

It's important to choose the appropriate text field `type` based on the type of content that users are expected to enter.
This ensures that the input is validated and processed correctly.

Input is a wrapper over the [InputControl](?path=/docs/components-core-form-inputcontrol--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs)
component to provide additional functionality such as labelling, helper error messages, and validation.
