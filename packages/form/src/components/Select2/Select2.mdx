The Select component provides a way for users to select an option from a dropdown list.
It allows users to choose from a set of predefined options, which can be customized to suit the needs of the application.
It provides a range of customization options to control the appearance and behavior of the switch,
as well as additional props for accessibility and guidance.

Select2 is a wrapper over the [Select2Control](?path=/docs/components-core-form-select2control--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs)
component to provide additional functionality such as labelling, helper error messages, and validation.
