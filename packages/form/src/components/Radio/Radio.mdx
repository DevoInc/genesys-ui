Component used to create radio buttons, which are part of radio groups that describe a set of related options.
Radio buttons are typically represented as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected.
A radio group allows only one radio button to be selected at a time, making it useful for options where the user can make only one selection.
It provides a range of customization options to control the appearance and behavior of the switch,
as well as additional props for accessibility and guidance.

Radio is a wrapper over the [RadioControl](?path=/docs/components-core-form-radiocontrol--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs)
component to provide additional functionality such as labelling, helper error messages, and validation.
