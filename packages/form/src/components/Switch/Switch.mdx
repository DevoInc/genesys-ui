A Switch component provides a visual toggle between two states, typically an on/off or enabled/disabled state.
It's an intuitive and compact way for users to quickly switch between two options. It provides a range of customization
options to control the appearance and behavior of the switch,
as well as additional props for accessibility and guidance.

Switch is a wrapper over the [SwitchControl](?path=/docs/components-core-form-switchcontrol--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs)
component to provide additional functionality such as labelling, helper error messages, and validation.
