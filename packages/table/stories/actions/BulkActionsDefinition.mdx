# Bulk actions definition

Bulk actions allow us to select and execute a series of actions on the selected elements.
Now we will define a series of behaviors in the different cases that may arise.

## Select all data

When we execute the action of selecting all elements, by default, all existing elements on
the current page will be selected.

When the action menu is displayed you will see the number of selected rows. Also in the table
you will see a warning of the number of selected rows where you can select all the available
rows of the table.

## Select data filter

The status of the selected rows will be maintained when a filter is applied. So you can make
a combined selection with different filters. 

Note here that the actions will have an effect on the rows visible in the filter. If you have
selected rows that are not visible in the new filter they will not apply the executed action.

## When there is no data in the applied filter

In case a filter has no data the bulkactions checkbox will appear as disabled.
