<Canvas of={Stories.States} />

The table rows can contain different states according to the needs. For it in the definition of rows we can define a preset property that will allow us to pass certain css styles that will be applied to each one of the rows.

From the library we have available a series of presets that will be applied by default when using the basic table component:
```ts 
type TPresetRow =
  | 'created'
  | 'deleted'
  | 'disabled'
  | 'draggable'
  | 'expanded'
  | 'highlighted'
  | 'isAfterRow'
  | 'isDragging'
  | 'modified'
  | 'selected';
```
Also with the style property inside rowDefs it will be possible to pass custom styles that are necessary to represent in the row.

```js
{
  style?:
    | CSSProp
    | (({
        theme,
        evenOddType,
        striped,
      }: {
        theme: DefaultTheme;
        evenOddType: 'even' | 'odd';
        striped: boolean;
      }) => CSSProp);
}
```
In the **StatesStriped** and **StatesNoStriped** examples you can see examples of each of the default states and even a custom state.
