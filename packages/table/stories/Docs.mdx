# Table

Our `Table` component is separated from the core and could be imported like this

<Source
  code={`
import { Table } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-table';
// or
import { BasicTable } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-table';
`}
/>

The `Table` component is a representation layer only, so we provide the
necessary components to transform it into a fully functional table.

For example you could use the `BasicTable` as a preconfigured Table for use all
the presets that we are exporting separately.

## Architecture

The `Table` has several concepts you should must know to build advanced tables
with it

- First of all, it is composible
- `Renderers` are in charge of render each cell, defined by the column, you
  could build custom ones or use our predefined `Renderers`.
- Same as `Renderers` are the `Editors` that are responsables to make the cell
  editable (also you must to indicate that the table and the cell are editable),
  in the same way you could build your own Editors or use the provided ones, or
  even compose the provided ones with your own customization.
- `Filters` are the same but for the header so you could have a custom filter
  ready for your column, we provide several ones but you always could use your
  owns.
- `HeaderRenderer` are the same as `Renderers` but for the headers, in case you
  need a custom one.
- `ColDef` this is the column definition, here we can set the renderers,
  filters, etc.. that we need for our column
- `presets` with this concept the table are bundling several renderers, filters,
  etc, and default values for a column or columns

## Presets

Our presets are:

- text
- number
- boolean
- date
- link
- longText
- options
