# Highlight Table

The table supports two types of highlighting: by column and by row. You can apply these highlights individually or together.

## Column

The column definition now has a new **isHighlighted** property. This property tells us if the column should be highlighted or not. By means of events it is possible to control when to add or remove that property.

```ts
onCellMouseEnter?: ({
    colDef,
    rowDef,
    cellDef,
  }: {
    colDef: TColDef;
    rowDef: TRowDef;
    cellDef: TCellDef;
  }) => void;
onCellMouseLeave?: ({
  colDef,
  rowDef,
  cellDef,
}: {
  colDef: TColDef;
  rowDef: TRowDef;
  cellDef: TCellDef;
}) => void
```

We also provide a hook **useSetHighlight** that allows to add or remove the highlighting depending on the executed event.

```ts 
const {
    newColDefs,
    onCellMouseEnter,
    onCellMouseLeave,
  } = useSetHighlight(colDefs);
```
<Canvas of={Stories.Columns} />


## Row

The **highlightRowOnHover** property by default is set to false, once it is activated and you hover on a cell it will highlight the row.

<Canvas of={Stories.Row} />

There is a **highlightRowOnHoverFn** property with which we can use the row definition data to exclude the particular row. By default the rows after row are not highlighted.

```
highlightRowOnHoverFn?: (rowDef: TRowDef) => boolean;
```

## Column and row

<Canvas of={Stories.RowColumn} />
