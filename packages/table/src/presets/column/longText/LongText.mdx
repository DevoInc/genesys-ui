# Preset `longText`

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

The preset long text is a variation of the `text` preset that do several things:

- Use the `TextRenderer` renderer
- Use the `TextAreaEditor` as editor
- Use the `TexFilter` as filter
- Define a height of twice height for rowHeight (defined at column level)

In the example you are viewing a modified `longText` preset with the next
configuration:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`{
  ...
  preset: 'longText',
  rowHeight: 200,
  truncateLine: 0,
  ...
}`}
/>

Here the `truncateLine: 0` is telling to the `TextRenderer` to not truncate the
line. And the `rowHeight: 200` is defining the height for each element of the
column.
