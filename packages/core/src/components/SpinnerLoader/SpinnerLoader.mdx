# SpinnerLoader

This component is used to indicate to the user that a process or
action is being processed, and they should wait for it to complete.

It is often used as a loading indicator within other components such as buttons, icon
buttons, or overlays. The `SpinnerLoader` typically consists of a circular
animation that rotates indefinitely until the underlying action is complete.
