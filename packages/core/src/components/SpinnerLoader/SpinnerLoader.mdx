# SpinnerLoader

## Overview

The SpinnerLoader component is used to indicate to the user
that a process or action is being processed and they should wait for it to complete.
It is often used as a loading indicator within other components such as buttons,
icon buttons, or overlays. The SpinnerLoader typically consists of a circular
animation that rotates indefinitely until the underlying action is complete.
