# Radio

Component used to create radio buttons, which are part of radio groups that
describe a set of related options.
Radio buttons are typically represented as small circles, which are filled or
highlighted when selected.
A radio group allows only one radio button to be selected at a time, making it
useful for options where the user can make only one selection.
It provides a range of customization options to control the appearance and
behavior of the switch, as well as additional props for accessibility and
guidance.

Radio is a wrapper over the
[RadioControl](?path=/docs/components-core-form-radiocontrol--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs)
component to provide additional functionality such as labeling, helper error
messages, and validation.
