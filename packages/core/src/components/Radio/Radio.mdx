# Radio

Component used to create radio buttons, which are part of radio groups that
describe a set of related options. Radio buttons are typically represented as small circles,
which are filled or highlighted when selected.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Radio } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

A radio group allows only one radio button to be selected at a time, making it
useful for options where the user can make only one selection.

It provides a range of customization options to control the appearance and
behavior of the switch, as well as additional props for accessibility and
guidance.

Radio is a wrapper over the [RadioControl](?path=/docs/components-core-form-radiocontrol--docs)
component, and uses the [Field](?path=/docs/components-core-form-field--docs) component to provide
additional functionality such as labeling, helper error messages, and validation.

## In a group

The `Radio` is almost always used in a group with other `Radio` components. This is the example with a
`RadioGroup` component wrapping some radios. If we want an uncontrolled behavior, we need to assign the same name
to all the radios.
