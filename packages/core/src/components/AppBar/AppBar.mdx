# AppBar

## Overview

Component used for creating a navigation bar. It can be customized to fit
various use cases.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { AppBar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is based in a `Box` component as its container, so we have
available almost all the props of this type. We have also an inner container
with an `HFlex` component, so we get flex distribution of the different
pre-defined blocks as children.

You have available some props to define quickly the most common contents of
this component: `heading` and `tabs`, but anyway you can use also the
pre-defined components `AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`, `AppBar.Heading` and
`AppBar.Divider` if you need something custom, or use only `children`... etc.

These are the pre-defined components:

- **AppBar.Item**: it's the equivalent to the `Flex.Item` component, and we only
  have to use it when we need to apply some specific layout behavior to the
  child: flex, width, align... etc.
- **AppBar.Divider**: it's based on the `Divider` component, and it's used as
  separator between the children.
- **AppBar.Heading**: it's based on the `Typography.Heading` component, and
  it's used at the beginning of the bar as the content title.
- **AppBar.Navigation**: it's the navigation block, and its child should be a
  `Tabs` component with the prop `colorScheme` to 'primary'.

Therefore, you have a lot of different ways of defining the content of the
`AppBar`:

- Only using the props (`heading` and `tabs`).
- Using the props `heading` and `tabs`, combined with `children`.
- Only using `children`.
- Only using pre-defined components `AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`,
  `AppBar.Heading` and `AppBar.Divider`.
- A mix using props and pre-defined components.

## Cases

### Compact

Sometimes, your app or page has its own app bar, so in these cases you can use
the `compact` variant with less height and spacing.

<Canvas of={Stories.Compact} />

<Canvas of={Stories.CompactWithAnotherToolbar} />

### Custom content

You can create a custom `AppBar`content using the pre-defined components
(`AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`, `AppBar.Heading` and `AppBar.Divider`) or
using the props `heading` and `tabs`, combined with children:

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />
