# AppBar

## Overview

Component used for creating a navigation bar. It can be customized to fit various use cases.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { AppBar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is based in a `Box` component as its container, so we have available almost all the props
of this type. We have also an inner container with an `HFlex` component, so we get flex distribution
of the different pre-defined blocks as children.

You have available some props to define quickly the most common contents of this component: `heading` and `tabs`,
but anyway you can use also the pre-defined components `AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`, `AppBar.Heading` and
`AppBar.Divider` if you need something custom, or use only `children`... etc.

Therefore, you have a lot of different ways of defining the content of the `AppBar`:

- Only using the props (`heading` and `tabs`).
- Using the props `heading` and `tabs`, combined with `children`.
- Only using `children`.
- Only using pre-defined components `AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`, `AppBar.Heading` and `AppBar.Divider`.
- A mix using props and pre-defined components.

## Cases

### Compact

Sometimes, your app or page has its own app bar, so in these cases you can use the `compact` variant
with less height and spacing.

<Canvas of={Stories.Compact} />

<Canvas of={Stories.CompactWithAnotherToolbar} />

### Custom content

You can create a custom `AppBar`content using the pre-defined components (`AppBar.Item`, `AppBar.Navigation`,
`AppBar.Heading` and `AppBar.Divider`) or using the props `heading` and `tabs`, combined with children:

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />
