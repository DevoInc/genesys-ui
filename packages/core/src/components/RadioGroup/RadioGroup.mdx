# RadioGroup

Component used to render a group of radios with customizable properties.
The component takes in a set of child Radios components as its children prop,
and allows for additional customization through props like direction (which
determines whether the checkboxes are arranged vertically or horizontally),
legend (which provides a label for the group of checkboxes), or status.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { RadioGroup } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Uncontrolled

<Canvas of={Stories.Uncontrolled} />

## Controlled

<Canvas of={Stories.Controlled} />

## Required

<Canvas of={Stories.Required} />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## With validation message

Sometimes you need to give feedback to the user about the whole group, not only about one of the fields,
so you can combine the 'helper' and set the 'status' to 'error' or any other non-base one.

<Canvas of={Stories.Validation} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
