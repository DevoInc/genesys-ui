# RadioControl

Component used to create radio buttons, which are part of radio groups that
describe a set of related options. Radio buttons are typically represented as small circles, which are filled or
highlighted when selected.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { RadioControl } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

A radio group allows only one radio button to be selected at a time, making it
useful for options where the user can make only one selection. Therefore, this component is rarely used
individually or isolated, because it needs other options to be chosen between.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
