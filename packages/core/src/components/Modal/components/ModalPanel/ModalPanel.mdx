# Modal.\_Panel

Panel of the Modal component which wraps the header, body and footer blocks.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Modal } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Modal._Panel`, this is an internal component, that's because it has the `_` notation
after the period. This kind of component should only be used in a very specific context when we need a customization.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
