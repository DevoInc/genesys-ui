# Modal.\_Backdrop

Backdrop of the Modal component which renders the overlay and is able to receive the click
to close the Modal.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Modal } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Modal._Backdrop`, this is an internal component, that's because it has the `_` notation after the period.
This kind of component should only be used in a very specific context when we need a customization.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
