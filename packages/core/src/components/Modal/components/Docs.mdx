# Components

There is a set of components which have to/should be used to build a `Modal` component.
There are three components which are the base of the `Modal` component. This one is
based on `Panel` component, so these internal components are based in too:

- `Modal.Header`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Header` component, but with more limited available props.
- `Modal.Body`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Body` component, but with more limited available props.
- `Modal.Footer`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Footer` component, but with more limited available props.
  This last one is not strictly required to create a `Modal`.

There are also optional components, which are not strictly necessary to build the main `Modal`
component, and therefore they have the `_` prefix:

- `Modal._Backdrop`: it's the `Overlay` component as clickable background of the `Modal`.
- `Modal._Panel`: it's the `panel` component as direct parent of the `Panel` based internal components
  (`Panel.Header`... etc.).

This way, the `Modal` component used as the wrapper of the `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Body` and
`Modal.Footer` is a combination of a `Modal._Backdrop` and `Modal._Panel` components,
so the real internal structure is:

```jsx
<Modal._Backdrop>
  <Modal._Panel>
    <Modal.Header />
    <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
    <Modal.Footer />
  </Modal._Panel>
</Modal._Backdrop>
```

Anyway, define the component with this structure is only necessary when you need to apply custom styles to the
`Modal._Backdrop` or `Modal._Panel`. That's the reason these types of component have the prefix `_`,
because they are optional for building the main component. Therefore, the most times you will use this structure:

```jsx
<Modal>
  <Modal.Header />
  <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer />
</Modal>
```
