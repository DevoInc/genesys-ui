# Modal

## Overview

Component designed to display content or messages in a pop-up window that appears on top of the current screen.
It provides a flexible and customizable way to display important information or prompt the user for
input in a separate pop-up window without disrupting the main flow of the application.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Modal } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

There is a set of components which have to/should be used to build a `Modal` component.
There are three components which are the base of the `Modal` component. This one is
based on `Panel` component, so these internal components are based in too:

- `Modal.Header`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Header` component, but with more limited available props.
- `Modal.Body`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Body` component, but with more limited available props.
- `Modal.Footer`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Footer` component, but with more limited available props.
  This last one is not strictly required to create a `Modal`.

<Source
  code={`
<Modal>
  <Modal.Header />
  <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer />
</Modal>
`}
/>

There are also optional components, which are not strictly necessary to build the main `Modal`
component and therefore they have the `_` prefix:

- `Modal._Backdrop`: it's the `Overlay` component as clickable background of the `Modal`.
- `Modal._Panel`: it's the `panel` component as direct parent of the `Panel` based internal components
  (`Panel.Header`... etc.).

This way, the `Modal` component used as the wrapper of the `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Body` and
`Modal.Footer` is a combination of a `Modal._Backdrop` and `Modal._Panel` components,
so the real internal structure is:

<Source
  code={`
<Modal._Backdrop>
  <Modal._Panel>
    <Modal.Header />
    <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
    <Modal.Footer />
  </Modal._Panel>
</Modal._Backdrop>
`}
/>

Anyway, define the component with this structure is only necessary when you need to apply custom styles to the
`Modal._Backdrop` or `Modal._Panel`. That's the reason these types of component have the prefix `_`,
because they are optional for building the main component.

## With actions

The Modal component can also be used to display a header with actions.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithActions} />

## Adding animations

If you want to add animations to your Modal component,
you can use a third-party animation library to achieve this effect.
For example, you can use `framer-motion` library along with a simple fade animation to create a more visually appealing display of the modal window.

<Canvas of={Stories.Animated} />

## Custom modal

If you want to build a custom modal, you can use the internal components.

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />
