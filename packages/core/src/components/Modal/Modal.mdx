# Modal

## Overview

Component designed to display content or messages in a pop-up window that appears on top of the current screen.
It provides a flexible and customizable way to display important information or prompt the user for
input in a separate pop-up window without disrupting the main flow of the application.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Modal } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### With actions

The Modal component can also be used to display a header with actions.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithActions} />

### Adding animations

If you want to add animations to your Modal component,
you can use a third-party animation library to achieve this effect.
For example, you can use `framer-motion` library along with a simple fade animation to create a more visually appealing display of the modal window.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Animated} />

### Custom modal

If you want to build a custom modal, you can use the internal subcomponents.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Custom} />
