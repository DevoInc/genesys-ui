# Modal

Component designed to display content or messages in a pop-up window that
appears on top of the current screen.

It provides a flexible and customizable way to display important information or prompt the user
for input in a separate pop-up window without disrupting the main flow of the application.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Modal } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

There is a set of components which have to/should be used to build a `Modal`
component. There are three components which are the base of the `Modal`
component. This one is based on `Panel` component, so these internal components
are based in too:

- `Modal.Header`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Header` component, but with more
  limited available props.
- `Modal.Body`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Body` component, but with more
  limited available props.
- `Modal.Footer`: it's equivalent to the `Panel.Footer` component, but with
  more limited available props. This last one is not strictly required to create
  a `Modal`.

<Source
  code={`
<Modal>
  <Modal.Header />
  <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer />
</Modal>
`}
/>

There are also optional components, which are not strictly necessary to build
the main `Modal` component, and therefore they have the `_` prefix:

- `Modal._Backdrop`: it's the `Overlay` component as clickable background of
  the `Modal`.
- `Modal._Panel`: it's the `panel` component as direct parent of the `Panel`
  based internal components (`Panel.Header`... etc.).

This way, the `Modal` component used as the wrapper of the `Modal.Header`,
`Modal.Body` and `Modal.Footer` is a combination of a `Modal._Backdrop` and
`Modal._Panel` components, so the real internal structure is:

<Source
  code={`
<Modal._Backdrop>
  <Modal._Panel>
    <Modal.Header />
    <Modal.Body>{children}</Modal.Body>
    <Modal.Footer />
  </Modal._Panel>
</Modal._Backdrop>
`}
/>

Anyway, define the component with this structure is only necessary when you need
to apply custom styles to the `Modal._Backdrop` or `Modal._Panel`. That's the
reason these types of component have the prefix `_`, because they are optional
for building the main component.

## Opened by a trigger

This is an example with a trigger which opens the `Modal` component,
and we also get closable behavior for the panel.

<Canvas of={Stories.OpenedByTrigger} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

## With actions

The Modal component can also be used to display a header with actions.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithActions} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

## Dialog

Sometimes the modal requires user interaction to provide critical information, gather input, or confirm actions,
and typically blocks interaction with the main application until dismissed or an action is taken. For instance,
when the user is about to delete some important entity.

<Canvas of={Stories.Dialog} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

## Adding animations

If you want to add animations to your Modal component, you can use a
third-party animation library to achieve this effect.
For example, you can use `framer-motion` library along with a simple fade
animation to create a more visually appealing display of the modal window.

<Canvas of={Stories.Animated} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />

## Custom modal

If you want to build a custom modal, you can use the internal components `Modal._Backdrop`
and `Modal._Panel`, but we don't recommend to do this way.

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} story={{ height: '40rem' }} />
