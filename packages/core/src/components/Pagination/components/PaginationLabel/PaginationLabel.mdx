# Pagination.\_Label

The initial info of the Pagination component. Usually to show how many items
are rendered.

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only
the main component `Pagination` and its props.

In these cases, you can use this Internal component (\_ notation) to define that specific usage.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway, it's available for very specific needs.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Pagination } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

You have to define the component as dot notation of the main one as `Pagination._Label`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Custom content

<Canvas of={Stories.UsingCustomContent} />

## Custom texts and color scheme

<Canvas of={Stories.UsingCustomTexts} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
