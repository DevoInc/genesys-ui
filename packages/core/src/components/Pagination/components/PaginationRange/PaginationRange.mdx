# Pagination.Range

The selector to define the range of items per page in the Pagination component.

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only
the main component `Pagination` and its props.

In these cases, you can use this Internal component (\_ notation) to define that specific usage.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway, it's available for very specific needs.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Pagination } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

You have to use the component as dot notation of the main component as `Pagination.Range`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
