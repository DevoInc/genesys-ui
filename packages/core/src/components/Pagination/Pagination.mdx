# Pagination

## Overview

Component that provides a set of controls to navigate through a large set of
data that is divided into pages.
There is a set of components which has to be used to create a `Pagination`
component.
These are the pre-defined components based on dot notation:

- `Pagination.Label`: The initial info block. Usually to show how many items
  are rendered. E.g. '1 - 5 of 150 items'.
- `Pagination.Range`: The selector to define the range of items per page.
- `Pagination.Nav`: The page navigation.

Depending on the space or other circumstances you can use all these components
or only some of them. In the same way, the `Pagination.Nav` component has props
to hide some parts.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Pagination } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.UsePagination} />
