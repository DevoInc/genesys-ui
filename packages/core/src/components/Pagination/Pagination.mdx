# Pagination

Component that provides a set of controls to navigate through a large set of
data that is divided into pages.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Pagination } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Custom usage

If you need a customization, or simply you want to show/hide some of the blocks: label, first-last buttons... etc.
there are its internal components available following dot notation:

- `Pagination.Label`: The initial info block. Usually to show how many items
  are rendered. E.g. '1 - 5 of 150 items'.
- `Pagination.Range`: The selector to define the range of items per page.
- `Pagination.Nav`: The page navigation.

Depending on the space or other circumstances you can use all these components
or only some of them. In the same way, the `Pagination.Nav` component has props
to hide some parts, as in this example where the first and last page buttons are hidden.

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />
