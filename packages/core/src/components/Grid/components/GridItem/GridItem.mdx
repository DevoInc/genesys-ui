# Grid.Item

## Overview

Grid.Item is a subcomponent and integral part of the Grid component and must always be used in conjunction with it.
It represents the individual columns or rows of the Grid layout.
By setting the appropriate attributes, Items can be configured to span across multiple columns and/or rows.

It is important to note that using the Grid.Item component on its own without the Grid component is meaningless, as its purpose is to serve as a subcomponent of the Grid layout.

## How to import
