# Grid.Item

Grid.Item is an internal component and integral part of the Grid component and
must always be used in conjunction with it.

It represents the individual columns or rows of the Grid layout.
By setting the appropriate attributes, Items can be configured to span across
multiple columns and/or rows.

It is important to note that using the Grid.Item component on its own without
the Grid component is meaningless, as its purpose is to serve as an internal
component of the Grid layout.
