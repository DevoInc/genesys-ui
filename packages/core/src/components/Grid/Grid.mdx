## [Overview](#overview)

The Grid component provides a powerful grid-based layout system for designing
user interfaces with rows and columns. It is based on the *CSS Grid Layout*,
and includes two components: __Grid__ and __Grid.Item__. Grid and Grid.Item must always be used together.

The Grid component is a grid container that establishes a new grid formatting
context for its contents, while the Grid.Item component represents the columns
or rows of the grid and can be set to span multiple columns and/or rows.
Both components are built from the [Box](?path=/docs/components-core-layout-box--docs)
component, providing them with basic
layout props such as margin, padding, width, and height.
