# Grid

## Overview

The Grid component provides a powerful grid-based layout system for designing
user interfaces with rows and columns. It is based on the _CSS Grid Layout_,
and includes two components: **Grid** and **Grid.Item**. Grid and Grid.Item must always be used together.

The Grid component is a grid container that establishes a new grid formatting
context for its contents, while the Grid.Item component represents the columns
or rows of the grid and can be set to span multiple columns and/or rows.
Both components are built from the [Box](?path=/docs/components-core-layout-box--docs)
component, providing them with basic
layout props such as margin, padding, width, and height.

## How to import

There are two components that have to do with CSS Grid Layout: **Grid** and **Grid.Item**.
These components must always be used together, it is useless to use them separately.

- **Grid**: this is a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting
  context for its contents. This
- **Grid.Item**: a Grid (grid container) contains Grid.Items. This component
  represents the columns or rows of the Grid. Grid.Items can be set to span
  multiple columns and/or rows.

Grid and Grid.Item are built from the
[Box](/?path=/docs/public-atoms-box--box) component to provide them with some
basic layout props such as: margin, padding, width, height, etc.
