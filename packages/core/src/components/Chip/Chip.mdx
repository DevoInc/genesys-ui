# Chip

Chips are small, versatile components that can represent various types of input,
characteristics, or activities. They enable users to enter data, select options,
filter content, or trigger specific functions within an application.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Chip } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Multiple selection controlled

In scenarios where multiple selections are allowed (using a form checkbox
behavior), you can use a controlled Chip with a rendered form checkbox input as
HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleControlled} />

## Multiple selection uncontrolled

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, you cannot use the onChange event handler
and must use the native behavior of a checkbox.
This way you will get an uncontrolled Chip with rendered form checkbox input as
HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.
However, with an uncontrolled behavior, you cannot manage the change of the icon
depending on whether the internal checkbox is checked or not.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

## Single selection controlled

When a single selection is required (using a form radio behavior), you must add
the selectionScheme prop and set it to 'single'.
This way, you will get a controlled Chip with rendered form radio input as HTML
and its corresponding keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleControlled} />

## Single selection uncontrolled

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, you must assign the name prop with the
same value for every Chip.
You cannot use the onChange event handler and must use the native behavior of a
radio group.
This way you will get an uncontrolled Chip with rendered form radio input as
HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.

## Readonly

Sometimes you might need to have a Chip only for giving feedback, or it's removable but not interactive. In these cases
you have to set the 'state' prop to 'readonly', and the `Chip` won't be selectable or clickable.

<Canvas of={Stories.Readonly} />

## Removable

Sometimes you might need to have a `Chip` for filtering, so the applied filter is rendered as a chip which is removable.
In this case, There are two props to be used: 'removable' and 'onRemove'.

Setting the first one to true, a remove icon button is rendered to the right of the content, and the second one is
to define the function which will be launched when that icon button is clicked.

This type of `Chip` could be interactive or not, depending on the 'state' prop is set to 'readonly' or not.

<Canvas of={Stories.Removable} />

## Custom based in internal components

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the component and its props.

In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define that specific usage.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific needs.
