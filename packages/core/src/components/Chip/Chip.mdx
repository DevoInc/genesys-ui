# Chip

## Overview

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Chip } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

### Multiple selection ::: controlled

When multiple selection is used (form checkbox behavior) you will get a controlled
Chip with rendered form checkbox input as HTML and its keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleControlled} />

### Multiple selection ::: uncontrolled

If you need an uncontrolled behavior then you can't use onChange so you can get the
native behavior of a checkbox. This way you will get an uncontrolled
Chip with rendered form checkbox input as HTML and its keyboard utility.
With uncontrolled way you can't manage the change of the icon depending on
the internal checkbox is checked or not.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

### Single selection ::: controlled

When a single selection is needed (form radio behavior), then you have to
add the `selectionScheme` prop to 'single'. This way you will get a controlled
ChoiceGroup with rendered form radio input as HTML and its keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleControlled} />

### Single selection ::: uncontrolled

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, then you have to assign the prop `name`
with the same value to every Chip. You can't use onChange so you can get the
native behavior of a radio group. This way you will get an uncontrolled
Chip with rendered form radio input as HTML and its keyboard utility.
