# Partitions

The Partitions component is used to render a set of partitions with varying
sizes and colors.

Each partition can be assigned a tooltip that is displayed when the user hovers
over it, providing additional information or context.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Partitions } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

You only have to assign a data configuration to the component to define each
partition.

You can assign with the `color` prop a specific color (#B474DD) or a pre-defined
color scheme (error, info, data-blue... etc.) to each partition
