# GridItem

The `Grid` component is based on **CSS Grid Layout** which offers a grid-based
layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier the way we design
grid-based user interfaces.

If you need any additional information about this CSS functionality, you can
consult it in the following links:

- [A Complete Guide to Grid | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).
- [CSS Grid | w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp).

There are two components that have to do with CSS Grid Layout: **Grid** and
**GridItem**. These components must always be used together, it is useless to
use them separately.

- **Grid**: this is a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting
  context for its contents. This
- **GridItem**: a Grid (grid container) contains GridItems. This component
  represents the columns or rows of the Grid. GridItems can be set to span
  multiple columns and/or rows.

Grid and GridItem are built from the
[Box](/?path=/docs/public-atoms-box--box) component to provide them with some
basic layout props such as: margin, padding, width, height, etc.
