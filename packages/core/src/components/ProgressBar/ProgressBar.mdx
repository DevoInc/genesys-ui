<H2>Overview</H2>

The ProgressBar component is used to display the progress of an ongoing task,
and to communicate either an undefined waiting time or the duration of a process to users.
It is an important visual indicator that informs users about the status of long-running or complex tasks,
and helps to improve the user experience by giving them a sense of how much time is left before the task is completed.
