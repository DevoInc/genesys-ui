# ProgressBar

## Overview

The ProgressBar component is used to display the progress of an ongoing task,
and to communicate either an undefined waiting time or the duration of a process to users.
It is an important visual indicator that informs users about the status of long-running or complex tasks,
and helps to improve the user experience by giving them a sense of how much time is left before the task is completed.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { ProgressBar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Circular

ProgressBar can be used in circular mode.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Circular} />

### With custom info

Or in linear mode with extra information.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithCustomInfo} />

### With validation helper and accessible

In case you need to add a validation/status helper, you can make the component more
accessible if you add an `id` value. This way, not only a `aria-invalid` is added to
the progress, but also we connect this one with its validation helper message through
the `aria-errormessage` attribute which is automatically added.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.AccessibleValidation} />

### With floating validation helper and accessible

Sometimes you might need to offer the validation helper to the user, but you don't have
enough space or the location of the progress doesn't allow to do that. In these cases
you can use the `hasFloatingValidation` prop to include that info in a floating `InlineMessage`.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.AccessibleFloatingValidation} />

### Custom based in internal components

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the component and its props.
In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define that specific usage.
We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific needs.

These components are inheriting automatically some props by context from its parent `ProgressBar._Container`:

- colorScheme.
- percent.
- size.
- status.
- type.
- withCustomInfo.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Custom} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
