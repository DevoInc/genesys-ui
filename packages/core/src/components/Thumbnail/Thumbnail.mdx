# Thumbnail

Component used for displaying a thumbnail image.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Thumbnail } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Aspect ratio

Using the `width`, `height`, `objectFit` and `objectPosition` props we can get
any aspect ratio, size or position for the `img` object. These are different
examples of how it's possible to combine this props in most common ways.

Although you use custom width or height, the proportion is maintained, because
the default value for `objectFit` is cover, so the image is sized to maintain
its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box.
If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then
the object will be clipped to fit.

### Custom width and height

When you need a specific width and height for the image.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomSize} />

### Width to fit container and custom height

When you want the image width to fit its container, and you need a specific
height.

<Canvas of={Stories.FitContainerCustomHeight} />

### Width to fit container and height auto

When you want the image width to fit its container, and you need a height auto.

<Canvas of={Stories.FitContainerHeightAuto} />

### Custom img object position

When you need a specific aspect ratio, but you want a custom image object
position.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomObjectPosition} />

## Radius

It's possible to specify the radius of the img based in the border-radius css
property.

<Canvas of={Stories.Radius} />
