# IconButton

## Overview

The IconButton component is a button component that displays an icon instead of
text.
Its purpose is to provide a more visually appealing and compact way to represent
actions or functionality within a user interface.
Icon buttons are commonly found in app bars, toolbars, items, rows and cells.
They are also appropriate for toggle buttons that allow a single choice to be
selected or deselected, such as marking or unmarking an item as favorite.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { IconButton } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Combined with dropdown

In some cases, you may need to use an IconButton to control a dropdown as well.
To indicate that the IconButton has a dropdown, you can use the hasDropdown
prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithDropdown} />

## As link

To use the IconButton as a link, simply add the href prop.
This will generate an `<a>` HTML tag instead of a `<button>` tag.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsLink} />

## With children

Although it is not a common use case, you can add children to the IconButton,
as shown in this example using the SpinnerLoader component.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithChildren} />

## Selectable multiple

The IconButton component can also be used as a form Radio or Checkbox.
When used this way, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with an
`<input type='radio'>` or `<input type='checkbox'>` inside.
To use the IconButton as a Radio group, it must be used only as part of a group
with the same value for the name prop.
This allows the previously selected option to be automatically deselected when a
new option is selected.

### Uncontrolled

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

### Controlled

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleControlled} sourceState="none" />

<Source
  code={`
const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);
return (
  <IconButton
    icon={selected ? 'heart_full' : 'like_heart_favorite_rating_love'}
    selectionScheme="multiple"
    state={selected ? 'selected' : 'enabled'}
    onChange={() => setSelected(!selected)}
    value="Option"
  />
);
`}
/>

## Selectable single

### Uncontrolled

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleUncontrolled} />

### Controlled

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleControlled} sourceState="none" />

<Source
  code={`
const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);
return (
  <IconButton
    icon={selected ? 'heart_full' : 'like_heart_favorite_rating_love'}
    name="option"
    selectionScheme="single"
    state={selected ? 'selected' : 'enabled'}
    onChange={() => setSelected(!selected)}
    value="Option"
  />
);
`}
/>

## Custom based in internal components

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the
component and its props.
In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define
that specific usage.
We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs.
