# IconButton

## Overview

Icon buttons are commonly found in app bars, toolbars, items, rows and cells.

Icons are also appropriate for toggle buttons that allow a single choice to be
selected or deselected, such as adding or removing a star to an item.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { IconButton } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Combined with dropdown

Sometimes you might need to use an IconButton and communicate that it controls
a dropdown too, so the dropdown icon is added. You only have to add the `hasDropdown` prop.

<Source
  code={`
<IconButton icon="time_edit" hasDropdown />
`}
/>

### As link

To get a link you only have to add the `href` prop, and then you will get an `<a>` html tag
instead of a `<button>` one.

<Source
  code={`
<IconButton
  href="https://www.devo.com"
  icon="connections_links"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  target="_blank"
  title="Go to Devo"
/>
`}
/>

### With children

It's not the common use of an `IconButton`, but sometimes you might need to add
`children`, as in this example with a `SpinnerLoader` component.

### Selectable

This is a IconButton which can be used as a form Radio or as a form Checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with a `<input type='radio'>` or
`<input type='checkbox'>` inside. At the same way, to use as a Radio group it
must be used only as part of a group with the same value for `name` prop.
This allows to unselect automatically the previous selected option when another
one is selected, because this type of selection is always unique.
