<H2>Overview</H2>

The IconButtonClose is a special type of IconButton designed to be used
in contexts where it is necessary to close a block of content that is not included in the regular flow of the DOM.
It is commonly used in Modals, Toasts, Poppers, and similar elements where a close button is required.
By clicking on the IconButtonClose, users can easily dismiss or close the content without disrupting the layout or flow of the page.
