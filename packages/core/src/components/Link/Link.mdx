<Heading.H2>Overview</Heading.H2>

The `Link` component facilitates user navigation to different destinations such as a different page, another section of the same page, or a different view.
To make the navigation possible, several props such as `href` or `onClick` are available.

<Heading.H3>Block behavior</Heading.H3>

The Link component can be utilized as either an inline or block element.
By default, the component is displayed as inline-flex and is integrated with the flow of its parent content.
However, by using the `wide` prop, the Link is displayed as flex and becomes a block element that is separate from the surrounding content.
