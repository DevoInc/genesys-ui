# Link

## Overview

The `Link` component is used for users to navigate to another place. This place
could be a different page, another section of the same page,
a different view... etc.

# How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Link } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

To make possible this navigation we can use the 'href' or 'onClick' props.

<Source
  code={`
const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(0);
const increaseCounter = () => setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
const [counterNav, setCounterNav] = React.useState(0);
const increaseCounterNav = () =>
  setCounterNav((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
  
return (
  <Box marginBottom={'cmp-xxs'}>
    <Link href={null} onClick={increaseCounter}>
      This is a link with no href provided but with onClick.
    </Link>
  </Box>
);
`}
/>

We can use the `Link` component as inline or block element. By default, the
component is displayed as 'inline-flex', and it's integrated with the flow of
its parent content. However if we use the 'wide' prop, the `Link` is displayed as 'flex', and it's
a block element separated from the rest of contents:

<Source
  code={`
<Link wide>Star light muse</Link> about extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence hydrogen atoms astonishment Hypatia. Descended from
astronomers dream of the mind&apos;s eye cosmic fugue something incredible
is waiting to be known rings of Uranus inconspicuous motes of rock and
gas.
`}
/>
