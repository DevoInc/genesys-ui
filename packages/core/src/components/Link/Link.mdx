# Link

## Overview

The `Link` component facilitates user navigation to different destinations such as a different page, another section of the same page, or a different view.
To make the navigation possible, several props such as `href` or `onClick` are available.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Link } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Block behavior

The Link component can be utilized as either an inline or block element.
By default, the component is displayed as inline-flex and is integrated with the flow of its parent content.
However, by using the `wide` prop, the Link is displayed as flex and becomes a block element that is separate from the surrounding content.

<Canvas of={Stories.Block} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
