# Link

This component facilitates user navigation to different destinations such
as a different page, another section of the same page, or a different view.

To make the navigation possible, several props such as `href` or `onClick` are
available.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Link } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Status

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

## Underlined

Sometimes you might need to make more visible the `Link` because of the context,
so you can use the 'underlined' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Underlined} />

## Block behavior

The Link component can be utilized as either an inline or block element.
By default, the component is displayed as inline-flex and is integrated with the
flow of its parent content.
However, by using the `wide` prop, the Link is displayed as flex and becomes a
block element that is separate from the surrounding content.

<Canvas of={Stories.Block} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
