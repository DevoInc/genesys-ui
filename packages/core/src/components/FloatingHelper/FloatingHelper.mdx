# FloatingHelper

Component that provides a floating message to assist the user with a particular
task or input.

Usually is used to provide helping info to the user when is filling a form, and
we want to save screen space avoiding use docked helpers in the fields.

Usually is located at the right of the label of a form field or directly at the
right of the own field when the label is hidden.
