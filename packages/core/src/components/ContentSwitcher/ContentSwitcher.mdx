# ContentSwitcher

## Overview

Component that allows users to switch between different content sections within a single UI element, typically within a navigation context.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { ContentSwitcher } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Accessible example with content

To ensure full accessibility of the component, we need to consider multiple aspects. These include:

- Adding the value of the id attribute of the block controlled by each tab as the value of the `aria-controls` prop. To do this, we must first add the `id` prop to the content block.
- Assigning an `id` prop value to each tab so that it can be used by the controlled content blocks as the `aria-labelledby` prop value.
- Including `role='tabpanel'` in the controlled content blocks.
- Setting the `tabIndex` of the controlled content blocks to `0` in order to maintain the tabbing focus order.
