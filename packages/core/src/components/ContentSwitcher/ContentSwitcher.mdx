Description of the component.

`}

### Real accessible example with content

To make the component fully accessible we have to consider several aspects:

- Add as value of prop `aria-controls` of each tab, the value of the `id` attribute of the block whose contents
  or presence are controlled by the tab. Therefore we have to add that `id` attribute to the content block
- Add `id` prop value to each tab to be used after by the controlled content blocks as `aria-labelledby` prop value.
- Add `role='tabpanel'` to the controlled content blocks.
- Add `tabIndex=0` to the controlled content blocks to maintain the tabbibg focus order.
