### [Accessible example with content](#accessible-example-with-content)

To ensure full accessibility of the component, we need to consider multiple aspects. These include:

- Adding the value of the id attribute of the block controlled by each tab as the value of the `aria-controls` prop. To do this, we must first add the `id` prop to the content block.
- Assigning an `id` prop value to each tab so that it can be used by the controlled content blocks as the `aria-labelledby` prop value.
- Including `role='tabpanel'` in the controlled content blocks.
- Setting the `tabIndex` of the controlled content blocks to `0` in order to maintain the tabbing focus order.
