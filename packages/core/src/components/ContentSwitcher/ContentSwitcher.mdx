# ContentSwitcher

Component that allows users to switch between different content sections within
a single UI element, typically within a navigation context.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { ContentSwitcher } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

Is a navigation block whose children are selectable options where only of those
can be selected at the same time (as in a radio group).

There is a pre-defined component to be used as child: `ContentSwitcher.Item`.
This component is a wrapper of the `Button` component, but with specific styles
and ready to read the context props from its parent.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

### Switching content

In any case, we have the navigation block, but obviously we need also the
content blocks to be switched:

<Canvas of={Stories.AccessibleWithContent} />

### Only icons

Sometimes you might need to get a switcher based only in icons, due to the available space, the context... etc.
In this case, you only have to assign an icon to each item, without assigning any child. When you use only icons,
have in mind that each item should have an explicative tooltip, even if the icon is very evident.

<Canvas of={Stories.OnlyIcons} />

### Using states

Usually we can get something functional, using a state which defines the
selected option and the function to change this. There could be multiple ways
to do that, but this could be an example:

<Source
  code={`
    import { ContentSwitcher, Box, VFlex } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
    const customCmp = () => {
      const [selection, setSelection] = React.useState('first');
      return (
        <VFlex>
          <ContentSwitcher>
            {data.map((option) => (
              <ContentSwitcher.Item
                onChange={() => {
                  setSelection(option.id);
                }}
                state={option.id === selection ? 'selected' : 'enabled'}
              >
                {option.label}
              </ContentSwitcher.Item>
            ))}
          </ContentSwitcher>
          {data.map((option) => (
            <Box
              aria-labelledby={option.id}
              display={option.id === selection ? 'block' : 'none'}
            >
              {option.content}
            </Box>
          ))}
        </VFlex>
      );
    `}
/>

### Accessibility

To ensure full accessibility of the component, we need to consider multiple
aspects. These include:

- Adding the value of the id attribute of the block controlled by each tab as
  the value of the `aria-controls` prop. To do this, we must first add the `id`
  prop to the content block.
- Assigning an `id` prop value to each tab so that it can be used by the
  controlled content blocks as the `aria-labelledby` prop value.
- Including `role='tabpanel'` in the controlled content blocks.
- Setting the `tabIndex` of the controlled content blocks to `0` in order to
  maintain the tabbing focus order.

<Source
  code={`
    import { ContentSwitcher, Box, VFlex } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
    ...
    const customCmp = () => {
      return (
        <VFlex>
          <ContentSwitcher>
            {data.map((option) => (
              <ContentSwitcher.Item
                aria-controls={'content-' + option.id}
                id={option.id}
              >
                ...
              </ContentSwitcher.Item>
            ))}
          </ContentSwitcher>
          {data.map((option) => (
            <Box
              aria-labelledby={option.id}
              id={'content-' + option.id}
              role="tabpanel"
              tabIndex={0}
            >
              ...
            </Box>
          ))}
        </VFlex>
      );
    `}
/>
