# Tabs.Item

This component is used to define each of the individual tabs.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Tabs } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Tabs.Item`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Tabs` or `Tabs` based component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## With badge

You can add a `Badge` to the content of the tab item, using a `Box` component with absolute position.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithBadge} />

## Closable

When you need a closable tab, you only have to assign a function to 'onClose' prop. You can add a tooltip for this close
button with the 'closeTooltip' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Closable} />

## Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Wide

If you need the tab item occupies the whole space available of its parent.

<Canvas of={Stories.Wide} />

## States

<Canvas of={Stories.States} />

## Advanced usage

If we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the
component we have its internal components available following dot notation.

- `Tabs.Item._Container`: the outermost container which distributes the tab elements.
- `Tabs.Item._Close`: close button to the right of the content.
- `Tabs.Item._Icon`: the icon at the beginning og the tab.
- `Tabs.Item._Link`: the clickable container of the content.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs, usually because we need custom styles for some piece of the component.
