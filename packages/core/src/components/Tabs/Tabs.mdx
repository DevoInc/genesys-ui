# Tabs

Navigation component that allows users to switch between different sections of
content in a tabbed interface.

It can be used to create a horizontal set of tabs, with each tab corresponding
to a different section of content.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Tabs } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There is a set of components which should be used to build a `Tabs` component.

- `Tabs`: the outer container of the component, which receives most of the props
  and allow its children to inherit them from the `TabsContext`.
- `Tabs.List`: the tab list items of the component.
- `Tabs.Item`: each tab of the component.
- `Tabs.Aside`: the custom content to be placed before or/and after the tab
  list items block.
- `Tabs.Divider`: the divider to apply separation between tab items or between
  the tabs block and the aside ones.
- `Tabs.Mark`: the active mark for the tab item which moves along the Tabs
  block.

This way, using all the available `Tabs` components we could have a structure
as this:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.Aside />
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item />
    <Tabs.Item />
    <Tabs.Item />
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Divider />
  <Tabs.Aside />
</Tabs>
```

In the other hand, to manage the active tab item, the movement of the active mark and the keyboard support
we have to combine a React.State (something as `const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = React.useState(0);`)
with the usage of the `useTabsAccessibility` hook [(More info)](##usetabsaccessibility) and
integrate what they provide with our components.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} sourceState="none" />

<Source code={tabsBasicUsageCode} />

## Aside content

<Canvas of={Stories.WithAsideContent} />

## Closable

<Canvas of={Stories.Closable} />

## Context

The `Tabs` component uses internally a React context which allows children to
inherit some props:

- `colorScheme`.
- `size`.
- `wide`.

This way you only have to pass these props to the `Tabs` parent component and
its children will inherit them automatically, as in this example inheriting the 'lg' size:

<Canvas of={Stories.Context} />

## Keyboard support

If you use the provided hook `useTabsAccessibility` then the keyboard support
will be available for the `Tabs`.

### Tab

- When focus moves into the tab list, places focus on the active tab element.
- When the tab list contains the focus, moves focus to the next element in the
  tab sequence, which usually is the 'tabpanel' element.

### Right arrow

- Moves focus to the next tab.
- If focus is on the last tab, moves focus to the first tab.
- Activates the newly focused tab.

### Left arrow

- Moves focus to the previous tab.
- If focus is on the first tab, moves focus to the last tab.
- Activates the newly focused tab.

### Home

Moves focus to the first tab and activates it.

### End

Moves focus to the last tab and activates it.

## Hooks

### How to import

<Source
  code={`import { useTabsAccessibility, useTabsMark } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`}
/>

### useTabsAccessibility

Hook to manage the active tab and the accessibility getting [keyboard support](#keyboard-support).

#### Parameters

- `activeTab`: the index of the active tab.
- `tabsRef`: the `ref` of the tabs list container.

<Source code={tabsBasicUsageCode} />

### useTabsMark

Hook to manage the active tab mark: its width and position based in the active
tab item and its parent container.
This hook provides:

- The `ref` of the tabs mark which is provided by `markRef`. It has to be
  passed as `ref` prop to the component which acts as mark.

#### Parameters

- `activeTab`: the index of the active tab.
- `tabsRef`: the `ref` of the tabs list container.
