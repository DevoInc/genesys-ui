Use `Flex` to create stacked groups of children components. These stacks can
distribute the children in a single row, in a column with the children
one under the other or in a mixed wrapped structure with rows and columns.
You have to use `FlexItem` props to separate each child from another one.

With Flex component we can get any flex structure by its css flex props: 'inline'
(display inline-flex instead of flex), 'flex-direction', 'justify-content',
'align-items', 'align-content' and 'flex-wrap'. If you need more info about css
flex, this is a good documentation web page reference:
