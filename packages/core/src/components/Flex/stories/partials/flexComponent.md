Component designed to create stacked groups of child components, with the flexibility
to distribute the children in a single row, a column with the children stacked vertically,
or in a mixed wrapped structure with rows and columns. To separate each child component, FlexItem props are used.

The Flex component allows us to create any flex structure using CSS flex properties such as 'inline'
(which uses display inline-flex instead of display flex), flex-direction, justify-content,
align-items, align-content, and flex-wrap. For more information on CSS flex, refer to
