<Heading.H1>Flex components</Heading.H1>

Flex container components are a powerful tool for creating stacked groups of child components.
These stacks can be arranged in various configurations, including a row,
a column with children stacked vertically, or a mixed wrapped structure with rows and columns.

The `Flex` component is the foundation, while `HFlex`, `VFlex`, and `Wrap`
are variations built upon it. Using `Flex` with `FlexItem` children allows
for complete control over the stack structure, while the other versions
offer simplified solutions for specific stack configurations:

- **Flex**: Allows for any stack type, including a single row, a single column, or a mixed configuration of rows and columns.
- **HFlex**: Creates a single row stack.
- **VFlex**: Creates a single column stack.
- **Wrap**: Creates a mixed stack of columns and rows.

<Heading.H2>How to import</Heading.H2>

<Source
  code={`
import { Flex, HFlex, VFlex, FlexItem, Wrap } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

Likewise, their `as` property allow these components to be rendered as any HTML tag:
'div', 'li', 'section'... etc.

If you want to use the `Flex` component rendered with a different HTML tag, you can use the `as` property.
It allows these components to be rendered as any HTML tag, such as div, li, section, and so on.

<Source
  code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { Flex, FlexItem } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';

const MyFlexCmp = () => (

{' '}

<Flex as={'ul'}>
  <FlexItem as={'li'}>Child 1</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem as={'li'}>Child 2</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem as={'li'}>Child 3</FlexItem>
</Flex>
); `} />

You can easily apply basic layout styles to flex components
such as margin, padding, width, height, min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height.
To do so, simply use the props with the corresponding names on the component.

<Source
  code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { Flex, FlexItem } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';

const MyFlexCmp = () => (

{' '}

<Flex marginBottom={'cmp-lg'} height={'100vh'} width={'100%'}>
  <FlexItem>Child 1</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem>Child 2</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem>Child 3</FlexItem>
</Flex>
); `} />

<Heading.H2>Structure</Heading.H2>

Flex components are containers that require their content
to be passed as children. If you want to apply spacing (margin or padding)
or layout styles (flex, height, width, etc.) to the children,
you can use the FlexItem component as a wrapper for each child.

<Source
  code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { Flex, FlexItem } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';

const MyFlexCmp = () => (

{' '}

<Flex>
  <FlexItem>Child 1</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem>Child 2</FlexItem>
  <FlexItem>Child 3</FlexItem>
</Flex>
);`} />

Similarly, when using HFlex, VFlex, or Wrap components,
it's necessary to wrap each child with FlexItem component
to enable the use of spacing, hSpacing, vSpacing, childrenFitFullHeight,
and childrenFitFullWidth props. In case you want the parent distribution
functionality for your children, then you must wrap children with FlexItem.

If you avoid using FlexItem to wrap each child, you'll require
your children to be components with layout styles or props.

Here's an example of a simple Flex structure with children without
FlexItem wrapping another component, as we only use them when
we need a specific configuration (width, height, flex...) for any child:

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Base} />

With a flex structure, we can customize the flex, order, and align-self
CSS styles for each child using the corresponding props of FlexItem.
Below is an example of a Flex component with each child having different flex and align-self styles:

<Canvas of={CaseFlexStories.FlexAndFlexItems} />

<Heading.H2>Component use cases</Heading.H2>

<Heading.H3>Flex</Heading.H3>

<Markdown>{flexComponent}</Markdown>

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Base} />

<Heading.H3>HFlex</Heading.H3>

HFlex creates a group of children components distributed in a single row.
Use the spacing prop to adjust the space between each child.

<Canvas of={HFlexStories.Base} />

<Heading.H3>VFlex</Heading.H3>

VFlex creates a group of children components distributed in a
single column. Use the spacing prop to adjust the space between each child.

<Canvas of={VFlexStories.Base} />

<Heading.H3>Wrap</Heading.H3>

Wrap creates a stacked group of children components distributed
in columns and rows. Use the vSpacing prop to adjust the vertical
spacing between each child and hSpacing to adjust the horizontal spacing.

<Canvas of={WrapStories.Base} />
