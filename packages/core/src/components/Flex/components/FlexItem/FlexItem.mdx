# Flex.Item

To achieve specific layout behaviors for individual child components in Flex
container components such as Flex, HFlex, VFlex, and Wrap, you can use Flex.Item
to wrap each child.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Flex } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Flex.Item`, because this component can be used to
define the behavior of `Flex` children, and it should be used always as a child of a `Flex` or `Flex` based
component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

To apply spacing and flex styles such as flex, align-self, order, width, and
margin, you can use Flex.Item props.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Playground} />

For more information on using Flex.Item components
as children of Flex container components,
refer to the Structure section in [Flex](?path=/docs/components-core-layout-flex-docs--docs).

## Using the as property

The `as` property allow these components to be rendered as any HTML tag:
'div', 'li', 'section'... etc.

If you want to use the `Flex` component rendered with a different HTML tag, you
can use the `as` property.
It allows these components to be rendered as any HTML tag, such as div, li,
section, and so on.

<Source
  code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { Flex } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';

const MyFlexCmp = () => (

<Flex as={'ul'}>
  <Flex.Item as={'li'}>Child 1</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item as={'li'}>Child 2</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item as={'li'}>Child 3</Flex.Item>
</Flex>
); `} />
