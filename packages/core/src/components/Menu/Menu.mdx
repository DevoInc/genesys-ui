# Menu

A component which generally represents a grouping of common actions or functions that the
user can invoke.

It can be also used to create navigation menu based in links, so in this case it's better to use the prop
`cmpRole` to `nav`.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Menu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

The `Menu` is used as a container of a group of `Menu.Item` and these can be
separated or grouped by `Menu.Heading` or `Menu.Separator`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Selectable options

The menu items can be used as selectable options. The role `menuitemcheckbox`
or `menuitemradio` is added automatically based in the `selectionScheme` prop
value. In addition, the 'aria-checked' attribute is set to true when the `Menu.Item`
has the 'state' prop value to 'selected.' The selection is totally controlled,
so you have to manage a React state to get the option selected.

### Single selection

<Canvas of={Stories.Selectable} />

Remember to set 'selectionScheme' to 'single' to get the correct 'menuitemradio' role.

### Multiple selection

Remember to set 'selectionScheme' to 'multiple' to get the correct 'menuitemcheckbox' role.

## As navigation

If the `Menu` is used as navigation we have to use the prop `cmpRole` to `nav`.
This way we get an HTML5 `nav` tag as container without `role` attribute because
it's implicit. In this case it's important that all the `Menu.Item` are links.

The `Menu.Item` is rendered automatically as a link (`<a>`) if it has defined
the `href` prop. In addition, as a link, the `Menu.Item` has no role because
it's not allowed to have any of the pre-defined roles ('menuitem',
'menuitemcheckbox' and 'menuitemradio') if it's not a child of a `role="menu"`
component.

## As dropdown menu

We can use the `Menu` component as a dropdown menu if we integrate it with the
`Popover` component. We even can nest menus using the `Menu.Item` components as
triggers.
