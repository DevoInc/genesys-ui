# Menu

## Overview

A `Menu` generally represents a grouping of common actions or functions that the user can invoke.
It can be also used to create navigation menu based in links, so in this case it's better to use
the prop `cmpRole` to `nav`.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Menu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

The `Menu` is used as a container of a group of `Menu.Item` and these can be separated or grouped by
`Menu.Heading` or `Menu.Separator`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Selectable options

The menu items can be used as selectable options. The role `menuitemcheckbox` or `menuitemradio`
is added automatically based in the `selectionScheme` prop value. In addition, a checkbox or radio
is rendered inside the menu item, but it's not visible, its purpose is manage the selection behavior.

### As navigation

If the `Menu` is used as navigation we have to use the prop `cmpRole` to `nav`. This way we get
an HTML5 `nav` tag as container without `role` attribute because it's implicit. In this case
it's important that all the `Menu.Item` are links.

The `Menu.Item` is rendered automatically as a link (`<a>`) if it has defined the `href` prop.
In addition, as a link, the `Menu.Item` has no role because it's not allowed to have any of
the pre-defined roles (menuitem, menuitemcheckbox and menuitemradio) if it's not a child of
a `role="menu"` component.

### As dropdown menu

we can use the `Menu` component as a dropdown menu if we integrate it with the `Popover` component.
We even can nest menus using the `Menu.Item` components as triggers.
