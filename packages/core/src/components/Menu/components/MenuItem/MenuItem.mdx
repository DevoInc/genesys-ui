# Menu.Item

This component is used to define each interactive and actionable menu element.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Menu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is defined with dot notation as `Menu.Item` and it should be a child of a `Menu` component.

## Append, prepend and bottom content

You can add at the beginning and at the end of the menu item custom content, in addition to the available
icon and label blocks, with the `prependContent` and `appendContent`. In the same way, you can add custom content
at the bottom of the menu item with the `bottomContent` prop, just below all the main content.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithAppendPrependAndBottomContent} />

## With description

As we said, you can add at the bottom of the menu item custom content with the `bottomContent`, so you can add
a description text block this way.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithDescription} />

## Selectable

The `Menu.Item` can be used as a selectable option. The role `menuitemcheckbox`
or `menuitemradio` is added automatically based in the `selectionScheme` prop
value. In addition, the 'aria-checked' attribute is set to true when it
has the 'state' prop value to 'selected.' The selection is totally controlled,
so you have to manage a React state to get the option selected.

## Interactive content

The `Menu.Item` usually is based in a `<button>` or `<a>` HTML element. This way, if we use as a child
of the item an interactive/focusable element (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`... etc.) it is a critical
error to get AA standard of accessibility.

This way, we have available the 'interactiveContent' prop which allow us to insert interactive content
at the end of the wrapper as a sibling of the main interactive content.

<Source
  code={`
  <li>
    <button>Menu item content</button>
    <div><button>Interactive content</button></div>
  </li>
`}
/>

<Canvas of={Stories.WithInteractiveContent} />

The block is positioned in absolute way and vertically aligned to the center. The width of this block
is assigned automatically to the padding-right of the main interactive content so it won't be overlapped.

## Readonly

Sometimes you might need that the item not to be interactive, because it's only an informative block, or it only needs
to give some feedback to the user. In those cases, you can set the value 'readonly' to the 'state' prop, and the menu
item won't be interactive neither selectable.

<Canvas of={Stories.ReadOnly} />

## Active for navigation

If you need that the menu item get activated styles, but without the selectable behavior and icon, you can set the
'state' prop to 'active'. This is often useful when we work with navigation menus.

<Canvas of={Stories.ActiveForNavigation} />

## Visual adjustments: quiet and linkStyled

If you apply the boolean 'quiet' prop, then the menu item will have no background color, and if you apply 'linkStyled'
prop, then the icon and label will get the same styles as the Link component.

<Canvas of={Stories.VisualAdjustments} />

## Custom content

You can add all the content of the `Menu.Item` by its prop `children`. You have
to keep in mind that the content probably will weed some extra space, specially
vertical one. This way the mouse events and selectable behavior still work.

Also, there are several internal pre-defined components as
`MenuItem._Container`, `MenuItem._Icon`... etc. so you can use them directly,
just in case you need small visual adjustments.
