# Components

Set of pre-defined components that can be used to build a `Menu` component.

## Item

The `Menu.Item` component is used to define each interactive and actionable menu
element.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={ItemStories.Base} />

### Append and prepend content

You can add at the beginning and at the end of the menu item custom content, in
addition to the available icon and label blocks.

<Canvas of={ItemStories.WithAppendAndPrependContent} />

### Selectable

The `Menu.Item` can be used as a selectable option. The role `menuitemcheckbox`
or `menuitemradio` is added automatically based in the `selectionScheme` prop
value. In addition, a checkbox or radio is rendered inside the item, but it's
not visible, because its purpose is manage the selection behavior.

<Canvas of={ItemStories.Selectable} />

### Custom content

You can add all the content of the `Menu.Item` by its prop `children`. You have
to keep in mind that the content probably will weed some extra space, specially
vertical one. This way the mouse events and selectable behavior still work.

Also, there are several internal pre-defined components as
`MenuItem._Container`, `MenuItem._Icon`... etc. so you can use them directly,
just in case you need small visual adjustments.

<Canvas of={ItemStories.CustomContent} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={ItemStories} />

## Separator

The `Menu.Separator` component is used to define a menu separator between menu
items.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={SeparatorStories.Separator} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={SeparatorStories} />

## Heading

The `Menu.Heading` component is used to define a menu heading to group menu
items.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Heading} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={HeadingStories} />
