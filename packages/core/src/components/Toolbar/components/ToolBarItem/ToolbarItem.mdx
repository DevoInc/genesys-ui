# ToolBar.Item

The item for each block of the Toolbar component. It's not strictly necessary to use this component
for each block of the Toolbar, but it's useful when you need some specific behavior.

It's based on `Flex` component so its interface and usage is almost the same.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Toolbar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Toolbar.Item`, it must be used only as a child of a `Toolbar` or `Toolbar` based component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />
