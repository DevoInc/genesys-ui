# Toolbar

A toolbar typically serves as a header that's situated at the top of the screen.

It may include the screen's title, as well as controls like navigation buttons,
a menu button, and other similar elements.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Toolbar  } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There are some pre-defined components to build a `Toolbar`component:

- The `Toolbar.Group` component is used to split the toolbar component in
  different sections. This is completely based in a `Flex` component with some
  default prop values.
- The `Toolbar.Item` component is used to create items to be used inside a
  `Toolbar.Group` or directly outside as child of the `Toolbar` component. This
  is completely based in a `Flex` component with some default prop values.
- The `Toolbar.Divider` component is used to create a separator mark between
  items. This is completely based in a `Divider` component with some default
  prop values.
