# Overlay

## Overview

The Overlay component adds an extra layer to the user interface,
allowing for an additional level of navigation or blocking the
screen to focus on a particular task. Its main features include
the ability to occupy the entire page (with a fixed position) or
be confined to a container (with a relative position).
The overlay can also be partially or fully opaque,
and comes in two primary color schemes: dark and light.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Overlay } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
