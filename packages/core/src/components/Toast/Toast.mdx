<H2>Overview</H2>

The Toast component is a wrapper around the [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) library's
emitter that provides additional custom props to configure its styles and content.
It is used to display non-intrusive, temporary messages to the user, such as notifications, success messages, or errors.

**Important:**

It is important to note that the ToastContainer component must
be rendered only once in the application tree to properly display the toasts.
If it is unclear where to place it,
rendering it at the application root is recommended.
For more information on installation and usage, refer to the [react-toastify documentation](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/installation#the-gist).
