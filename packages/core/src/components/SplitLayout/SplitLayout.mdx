# SplitLayout

## Overview

The SplitLayout component is a layout element that enables the division of the
screen into multiple blocks that are resizables.
With SplitLayout, you can easily create a split view layout, allowing users to
view multiple pieces of content simultaneously.

It can also be nested, allowing for the creation of more complex layouts, and
split vertically or horizontally, depending on the needs of the user interface.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { SplitLayout } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

Add the desired blocks as direct children of the SplitLayout. For each block a
resizable area is automatically created. Usually we need to define a height for
the parent container of the `SplitLayout` if we want a pre-defined height
regardless of whether there is content or not.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

Contained areas are rescaled as indicated by the areas themselves, for example,
in the next story we could see that

<Source code={`...
<Box>
  <SplitLayout ... >
    <Box>Lorem ...</Box>
    ...
  </SplitLayout>
</Box>
...`} />

The container `Box` doesn't have `height` and the contained `Box` don't do
anything special

<Canvas of={Stories.BaseWithoutHeight} />

But if we do specify the `height`

<Source code={`...
<Box height="20rem">
  <SplitLayout ... >
    <Box overflow="auto">Lorem ...</Box>
    ...
  </SplitLayout>
</Box>
...`} />

And set the contained `Box` with an `overflow="auto"`, this lead to this
behavior:

<Canvas of={Stories.BaseWithHeight} />

## Hooks

### `useAsyncSplitResize`

<Source code={`import { SplitLayout, useAsyncSplitResize } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
...
const [sizes, setSizes] = React.useState<TSizes>(props?.sizes);
const { onChange } = useAsyncSplitResize({ setSizes });
...
return (
  <Box height="20rem">
    <SplitLayout sizes={sizes} onChange={onChange} ... >
      <Box overflow="auto">Lorem ...</Box>
      ...
    </SplitLayout>
  </Box>
);
...`} />

<Canvas of={Stories.AsyncHook} />

### `useSyncSplitResize`

Is like the previous hook but modify the size with each dragged mouse movement.
There is a special property that we need to use with this hook: `showDragGhost:
false`, or the user will have twice the distance of the movement

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Min/Max size

If you need to define some limits for the panes you could use the min/max size
prop of each resize hook.

<Canvas of={Stories.MinSize} />

If you don't define a minSize for the blocks, when we resize one to the maximum
the other ends in `width: 0` or `height: 0`, so we recommend adding
`overflow: hidden` to the children blocks, to avoid maintaining visible
undesired contents or spaces. In the same way, you should also add the internal
padding to a nested children of the block, instead of directly to it, because of
the box model, which maintains the space of the padding although the width or
height is '0'.

This is an example without minimum, but with padding in the children blocks,
instead of in a nested one, and without applying `overflow:hidden`. We can see
how the content is not completely hidden when we resize the other one to the
maximum:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithoutMinSizeGood} />

In this example we apply `overflow:hidden` and the padding is defined in nested
blocks, so we can see how the content is completely hidden when we resize the
other one to the maximum:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithOverflowAndPadding} />

## Three blocks

This an example with three blocks with different sizes which define the widths of the blocks:

<Canvas of={Stories.Three} />

## Nested

Yoi can create nested resizable areas simply nesting `SplitLayout`components:

<Canvas of={Stories.Nested} />

## Dynamic content

<Canvas of={Stories.HiddenContent} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
