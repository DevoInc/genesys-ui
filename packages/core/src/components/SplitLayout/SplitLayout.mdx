# SplitLayout

## Overview

The SplitLayout component is a layout element that enables the division of the screen
into multiple blocks that are resizables.
It is based on [split.js](https://split.js.org/), so you could use all of the
properties of split.js.
With SplitLayout, you can easily create a split view layout, allowing users to view
multiple pieces of content simultaneously.

It can also be nested, allowing for the creation of more complex layouts, and
split vertically or horizontally, depending on the needs of the user interface.
