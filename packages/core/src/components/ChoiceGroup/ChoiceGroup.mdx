### [Multiple selection](#multiple-selection)

When multiple selection is used (form checkboxes behavior) you will get a controlled
ChoiceGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelectionControlled} />

### [Multiple selection uncontrolled](#multiple-selection-uncontrolled)

If you need an uncontrolled behavior then you can't use onChange so you can get the
native behavior of a checkbox. This way you will get an uncontrolled
ChoiceGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.
With uncontrolled way you can't manage the change of the icon depending on
the internal checkbox is checked or not.

### [Single selection](#single-selection)

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), then you have to
add the `selectionScheme` prop to 'single'. This way you will get a controlled
ChoiceGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

### [Single selection uncontrolled](#single-selection-uncontrolled)

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, then you have to assign the prop `name`
with the same value to every IconButton. You can't use onChange so you can get the
native behavior of a radio group. This way you will get an uncontrolled
ChoiceGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.
