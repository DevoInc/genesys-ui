<Heading.H2>Cases</Heading.H2>

<Heading.H3>Multiple selection controlled</Heading.H3>

In scenarios where multiple selections are allowed (using a form checkbox behavior),
you can use a controlled ChoiceGroup with a rendered form checkbox input as HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelectionControlled} />

<Heading.H3>Multiple selection uncontrolled</Heading.H3>

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, you cannot use the onChange event handler and must use the native behavior of a checkbox.
This way you will get an uncontrolled ChoiceGroup with rendered form checkbox input as HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.
However, with an uncontrolled behavior, you cannot manage the change of the icon depending on whether the internal checkbox is checked or not.

<Heading.H3>Single selection controlled</Heading.H3>

When a single selection is required (using a form radio behavior), you must add the selectionScheme prop and set it to 'single'.
This way, you will get a controlled ChoiceGroup with rendered form radio input as HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.SingleSelectionControlled} />

<Heading.H3>Single selection uncontrolled</Heading.H3>

If you need an uncontrolled behavior, you must assign the name prop with the same value for every IconButton.
You cannot use the onChange event handler and must use the native behavior of a radio group.
This way you will get an uncontrolled ChoiceGroup with rendered form radio input as HTML and its corresponding keyboard utility.
