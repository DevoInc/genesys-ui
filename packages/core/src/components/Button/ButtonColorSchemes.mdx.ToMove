# Button

## Button color schemes

Each button color scheme has a specific use which can be related with:

- Hierarchy level of its action: if it's the main action of the page, of the
  block, a secondary action... etc.
- Contextual needs: if we are using buttons in contexts as error, success,
  warning... etc.
- Visual needs: if we have to use a button in a dark background context, we
  will have to use a 'blend-inverse' color scheme to get the correct contrast.

### Accent high

This is the highest hierarchy level type. This type of button only can appear
once in each page or functionality, so it has to be the main action.

<Canvas of={Stories.AccentHigh} />

### Accent

This is the next hierarchy level type. This type of button can appear
more than once in each page or functionality, but is has to be a remarkable
action. E.g. the main action in a Modal, Panel... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Accent} />

### Neutral

This is the next hierarchy level type. This type of button can appear
more than once in each page or functionality. Usually it's used for filter
actions, triggering dropdowns, item or row actions... or for secondary
ones as cancel, back... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Neutral} />

### Blend base and blend inverse

At the same hierarchy level of 'neutral' we find these types of button. We use
these color schemes instead of 'neutral' for visual reasons, because we have
to include the button in a surface with a light or dark coloured background.

<Canvas of={Stories.Blend} />

### UI

UI color schemes: error, success, warning, help and info types. We can find
them at any hierarchy level, but always in a UI context.

### Quiet

At the lowest hierarchy level we can find quiet color scheme. They are used
always for secondary actions and in contexts with much density of contents.
