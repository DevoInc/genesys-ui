## Button Loading

The `Button` component has loading states to communicate that the process which
has been launched with its action is currently running, or it's been finished
successfully or with errors.

When the `state` prop value is `loading` always is rendered a spinner at the
left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by
this spinner.

We can use different values for `children` and `icon` based in each `state` loading
values to inform better about the process to the user. We can see examples of
this in the next stories.

### Button Loading success

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success` always is rendered a check icon
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be
replaced by this icon, but only for a seconds. In the same way, there is an
animation from original color scheme to success scheme, to come back again a few
seconds later to the original one.
