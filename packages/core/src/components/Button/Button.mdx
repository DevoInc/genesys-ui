# Button

Buttons enable users to take actions or make choices with a single tap.
They are typically placed throughout your UI, including in dialogs, modal
windows, forms, cards, or toolbars.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Button } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Button color schemes

Each button color scheme has a specific use which can be related with:

- Hierarchy level of its action: if it's the main action of the page, of the
  block, a secondary action... etc.
- Contextual needs: if we are using buttons in contexts as error, success,
  warning... etc.
- Visual needs: if we have to use a button in a dark background context, we
  will have to use a 'blend-inverse' color scheme to get the correct contrast.

### Accent high

This is the highest hierarchy level type. This type of button only can appear
once in each page or functionality, so it has to be the main action.

<Canvas of={Stories.AccentHigh} />

### Accent

This is the next hierarchy level type. This type of button can appear
more than once in each page or functionality, but is has to be a remarkable
action. E.g. the main action in a Modal, Panel... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Accent} />

### Neutral

This is the next hierarchy level type. This type of button can appear
more than once in each page or functionality. Usually it's used for filter
actions, triggering dropdowns, item or row actions... or for secondary
ones as cancel, back... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Neutral} />

### Blend base and blend inverse

At the same hierarchy level of 'neutral' we find these types of button. We use
these color schemes instead of 'neutral' for visual reasons, because we have
to include the button in a surface with a light or dark coloured background.

<Canvas of={Stories.Blend} />

### UI

UI color schemes: error, success, warning, help and info types. We can find
them at any hierarchy level, but always in a UI context.

<Canvas of={Stories.UI} />

### Quiet

At the lowest hierarchy level we can find quiet color scheme. They are used
always for secondary actions and in contexts with much density of contents.

<Canvas of={Stories.Quiet} />

## With icon

You can use our library [Genesys Icons](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-icons/?path=/story/gallery--icons)
to add an icon to the component, assigning directly the icon component to the 'icon' prop, but anyway you can use
any other icon library based in React components.

The icon can be rendered to the left or to the right of the label through 'iconPosition' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcon} />

## Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## States

<Canvas of={Stories.States} />

## As dropdown trigger

The `Button` component can be used as a dropdown trigger.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsDropdown} />

## As link

It can also be used as a link. In this case, the `href` prop must be used
instead of the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsLink} />

## Wide

To get the Button fills the whole space of its parent you can set the 'wide' prop to true.
Sometimes it might be useful when you need all the buttons to have the same width.

<Canvas of={Stories.Wide} />

## With badge

It's possible to add a badge to the component: if you use only apply 'hasBadge' the badge is added without content,
only as a marker, and if you also set 'badgeText', then the badge has content.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithBadge} />

## Loading

The `Button` component has loading states to indicate that a process launched
with its action is currently running, or has finished successfully or with
errors.

When the `state` prop value is `loading`, a spinner is always rendered at the
left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the spinner.

You can use different values for `children` and `icon` based on each `state`
loading values to better inform the user about the process.
Here are some examples:

<Canvas of={Stories.Loading} />

### Loading success

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success`, a check icon is always
rendered at the left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the check icon, but only
for a few seconds.
Additionally, there is an animation that changes the color scheme from the
original to the success scheme and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={Stories.Success} />

### Loading error

When the `state` prop value is `loading-error`, an error icon is always rendered
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be
replaced by the error icon, but only for a few seconds. Additionally, there is
an animation that changes the color scheme from the original to the error scheme
and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={Stories.Error} />

## Selectable

Buttons can be used as form radio or form checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with an `<input type='radio'>` or
`<input type='checkbox'>` inside.
To use as a radio group, it must be used only as part of a group with the same
value for the `name` prop.
This allows the previous selected option to be automatically deselected when
another one is selected because this type of selection is always unique.

### Selectable multiple

When `selectionScheme` is `multiple`, the `Button` component is used as a form
`checkbox`.
It can either be uncontrolled or controlled.

#### Uncontrolled

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

#### Controlled

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleControlled} />

### Selectable single

When `selectionScheme` is `single`, the `Button` component is used as a form
radio.

#### Uncontrolled

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleUncontrolled} />

#### Controlled

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleControlled} />

## Custom based in internal components

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the
component and its props.

In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define
that specific usage:

- `Button._Addon`
- `Button._Badge`
- `Button._Container`
- `Button._DropdownIcon`
- `Button._Icon`
- `Button._Label`
- `Button._Loader`
- `Button._Selection`

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs.
