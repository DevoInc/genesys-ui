### Button Loading

The `Button` component has loading states to communicate that the process which
has been launched with its action is currently running, or it's been finished
successfully or with errors.

When the `state` prop value is `loading` always is rendered a spinner at the
left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by
this spinner.

We can use different values for `children` and `icon` based in each `state` loading
values to inform better about the process to the user. We can see examples of
this in the next stories.

### Button Loading success

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success` always is rendered a check icon
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be
replaced by this icon, but only for a seconds. In the same way, there is an
animation from original color scheme to success scheme, to come back again a few
seconds later to the original one.

### Button Loading error

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success` always is rendered a check icon
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be
replaced by this spinner, but only for a seconds. In the same way, there is an
animation from original color scheme to error scheme, to come back again a few
seconds later to the original one.

### Selectable

Buttons can be used as a form Radio or as a form Checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with a `<input type='radio'>` or
`<input type='checkbox'>` inside. At the same way, to use as a Radio group it
must be used only as part of a group with the same value for `name` prop.
This allows to unselect automatically the previous selected option when another
one is selected, because this type of selection is always unique.
