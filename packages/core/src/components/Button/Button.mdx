# [Button](#button)

## [Overview](#overview)

Buttons enable users to take actions or make choices with a single tap.
They are typically placed throughout your UI, including in dialogs, modal windows, forms, cards, or toolbars.

## [How to import](#how-to-import)

<Source
  code={`
import { Button } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## [Basic usage](#basic-usage)

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## [Cases](#cases)

### [Button as dropdown trigger](#button-as-dropdown-trigger)

The `Button` component can be used as a dropdown trigger.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.AsDropdown} />

### [Button as link](#button-as-link)

It can also be used as a link. In this case, the `href` prop must be used instead of the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.AsLink} />

### [Button Loading](#button-loading)

The `Button` component has loading states to indicate that a process launched with its action
is currently running, or has finished successfully or with errors.

When the `state` prop value is `loading`, a spinner is always rendered at the left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the spinner.

You can use different values for `children` and `icon` based on each `state`
loading values to better inform the user about the process.
Here are some examples:

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Loading} />

### [Button Loading success](#button-loading-success)

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success`, a check icon is always rendered at the left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the check icon, but only for a few seconds.
Additionally, there is an animation that changes the color scheme from the original to
the success scheme and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Success} />

### [Button Loading error](#button-loading-error)

When the `state` prop value is `loading-error`, an error icon is always rendered
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced
by the error icon, but only for a few seconds. Additionally, there is an animation
that changes the color scheme from the original to the error scheme and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Error} />

### [Selectable](#selectable)

Buttons can be used as form radio or form checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with an `<input type='radio'>` or `<input type='checkbox'>` inside.
To use as a radio group, it must be used only as part of a group with the same value for the `name` prop.
This allows the previous selected option to be automatically deselected when another one
is selected because this type of selection is always unique.

### [Selectable multiple](#selectable-multiple)

When selectionScheme is `multiple`, the `Button` component is used as a form checkbox.
It can either be uncontrolled or controlled.

#### [Uncontrolled](#selectable-multiple-uncontrolled)

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

#### [Controlled](#selectable-multiple-controlled)

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.MultipleControlled} />

### [Selectable single](#selectable-single)

When selectionScheme is `single`, the `Button` component is used as a form radio.

#### [Uncontrolled](#selectable-single-uncontrolled)

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.SingleUncontrolled} />

#### [Controlled](#selectable-single-controlled)

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.SingleControlled} />
