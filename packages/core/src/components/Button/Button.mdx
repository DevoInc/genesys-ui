<Heading.H2>Overview</Heading.H2>

Buttons enable users to take actions or make choices with a single tap.
They are typically placed throughout your UI, including in dialogs, modal windows, forms, cards, or toolbars.

<Heading.H2>How to import</Heading.H2>

<Source
  code={`
import { Button } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

<Heading.H2>Basic usage</Heading.H2>

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

<Heading.H2>Cases</Heading.H2>

<Heading.H3>Button as dropdown trigger</Heading.H3>

The `Button` component can be used as a dropdown trigger.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.AsDropdown} />

<Heading.H3>Button as link</Heading.H3>

It can also be used as a link. In this case, the `href` prop must be used instead of the `onClick` prop.

<Heading.H3>Button Loading</Heading.H3>

The `Button` component has loading states to indicate that a process launched with its action
is currently running, or has finished successfully or with errors.

When the `state` prop value is `loading`, a spinner is always rendered at the left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the spinner.

You can use different values for `children` and `icon` based on each `state`
loading values to better inform the user about the process.
Here are some examples:

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Loading} />

<Heading.H3>Button Loading success</Heading.H3>

When the `state` prop value is `loading-success`, a check icon is always rendered at the left of the `Button`.
If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced by the check icon, but only for a few seconds.
Additionally, there is an animation that changes the color scheme from the original to
the success scheme and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Success} />

<Heading.H3>Button Loading error</Heading.H3>

When the `state` prop value is `loading-error`, an error icon is always rendered
at the left of the `Button`. If there is an icon at the left, it will be replaced
by the error icon, but only for a few seconds. Additionally, there is an animation
that changes the color scheme from the original to the error scheme and back again a few seconds later.

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Error} />

<Heading.H3>Selectable</Heading.H3>

Buttons can be used as form radio or form checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with an `<input type='radio'>` or `<input type='checkbox'>` inside.
To use as a radio group, it must be used only as part of a group with the same value for the `name` prop.
This allows the previous selected option to be automatically deselected when another one
is selected because this type of selection is always unique.

<Heading.H3>Selectable multiple</Heading.H3>

When selectionScheme is `multiple`, the `Button` component is used as a form checkbox.
It can either be uncontrolled or controlled.

<Heading.H4>Uncontrolled</Heading.H4>

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.MultipleUncontrolled} />

<Heading.H4>Controlled</Heading.H4>

<Canvas of={SelectionStories.MultipleControlled} />

<Heading.H3>Selectable single</Heading.H3>

When selectionScheme is `single`, the `Button` component is used as a form radio.
