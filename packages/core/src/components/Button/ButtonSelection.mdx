# Button

## Selectable

This is a Button which can be used as a form Radio or as a form Checkbox.
In fact, the generated HTML is a `<label>` with a `<input type='radio'>` or
`<input type='checkbox'>` inside. At the same way, to use as a Radio group it
must be used only as part of a group with the same value for `name` prop.
This allows to unselect automatically the previous selected option when another
one is selected, because this type of selection is always unique.
