# Tag

The Tag component is a small, visual element used to label, categorize, or
organize items using keywords that describe them.

Tags are typically displayed as text within a colored background they are static.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Tag } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## With icon

You can use our library [Genesys Icons](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-icons/?path=/story/gallery--icons)
to add an icon to the component, assigning directly the icon component to the 'icon' prop, but anyway you can use
any other icon library based in React components.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcon} />

## Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Quiet

Sometimes you might need the tag to be less prominent, so you can use the 'quiet' prop
setting to true.

<Canvas of={Stories.Quiet} />

## Wide

To get the Tag fills the whole space of its parent you can set the 'wide' prop to true.
Sometimes it might be useful when you need all the tags to have the same width.

<Canvas of={Stories.Wide} />

## Color schemes

There are several predefined color schemes for the component using the 'colorScheme' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.ColorSchemes} />

Anyway you can also assign directly a color, although we don't recommend doing this unless
you need a very specific customization. The color of the text is auto-generated depending on
getting AA contrast, so if the color is dark, the text color tends to white and if the color
is light, the text color tends to dark gray.
