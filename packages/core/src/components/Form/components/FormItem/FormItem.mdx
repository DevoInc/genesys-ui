# Form.Item

Component to get specific distribution for each child of a Form or FormGroup.

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Form.Item`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Form` or `Form` based component. In fact, it is usually a child of a `Form.Group` component.

When we work with a `Form` or a `Form.Group`, we only need to use a `Form.Item` tp wrap a field when we want a
specific behavior or structure for it: flex, vertical align, some event... etc. If we don't need this, then we can
add directly the field components as children of the `Form` or `Form.Group`, wihtout wrapping with `Form.Item`.

The `Form.Item` is based in the `Flex.Item` component, so it also has available all the layout props: padding, position,
margin... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Distribution

This is an example using the 'flex' prop to assign specific widths and using 'alignSelf' to align vertically
in a different way one of the items.
