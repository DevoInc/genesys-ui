# Form.Group

Component to create an HTML fieldset and distribute the form groups and fields inside it.

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Form.Group`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Form` or `Form` based component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Direction

Using the 'direction' prop you can define if the distribution of the fields is as a 'column' or as a 'row'.
Anyway, the main layout and flex props are also available, so you can use 'justifyContent', 'alignItems'... etc.
if you need a very specific distribution for your fields.

<Canvas of={Stories.Direction} />

## Boxed

If you need the group to be more prominent or differentiate it from other ones, you can set the 'boxed' prop to 'true'.

<Canvas of={Stories.Boxed} />

## Disabled

You can disable the group, setting the 'disabled' prop to true. Then the children opacity is reduced to the
'disabled' pre-defined value and the pointer events are disabled.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Fieldset

We get an HTML 'fieldset' as wrapper of the group if we set the 'asFieldset' prop to true. Then we can get the inherited
behavior of this type of element. If we combine this prop with the 'disabled' one, then we get the disabled attribute
for the fieldset HTML element.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsFieldset} />

## Collapsable

Sometimes, if you want to reduce the noise of the form, not showing from the beginning al the fields,
you can use the collapsable variant of the component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Collapsable} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
