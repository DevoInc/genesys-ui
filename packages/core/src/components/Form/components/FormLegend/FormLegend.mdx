# Form.Legend

Component that provides a legend to the form.

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Form.Legend`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Form` or `Form` based component.

This component will rarely be used, because the `From.Group` has already a 'legend' prop which renders
a `Form.Legend` at the beginning ogf the group.

## Required mark

You can add a required mark at the beginning of the legend, using the 'requiredMark' prop. You can add any
node or component, but usually is used the `Form.RequiredMark` component.

## Required mark

If the FormGroup which heads this FormLegend needs some extra info to be filled, then you can add a floating helper
to the component using the 'helper' prop. You can add any node or component, but usually is used
the `Form.FloatingHelper` component.

## AppendContent

Sometimes you might need to add a custom block at the right of the textual content, for instance, when you need
an action to add more fields, or something similar. Then you can use the 'appendContent' prop, which accepts
any node or component.
