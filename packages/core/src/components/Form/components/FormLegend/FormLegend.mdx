## Form.Legend

Component that provides a legend to the form.

### Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `Form.Legend`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Form` or `Form` based component.

This component will rarely be used, because the `From.Group` has already a 'legend' prop which renders
a `Form.Legend` at the beginning ogf the group.
