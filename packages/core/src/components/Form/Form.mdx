# Form

Component that creates an HTML form and manages the distribution of form groups
and fields within it. It can be used to simplify the process of creating forms in your application, by
allowing you to easily organize and manage form controls.

## How to import

## Basic usage

The Form component includes components that can be used to further customize
your forms, including Buttons, Group, Legend and Item.
These components can be accessed through the Form component and allow you to add
additional functionality and styling to your forms.

## Multiple fields distribution

You can define different groups with different distributions, using the `Form.Group` and `Form.Item` components. In the
same way, you can add a buttons block using `Form.Buttons` component.
