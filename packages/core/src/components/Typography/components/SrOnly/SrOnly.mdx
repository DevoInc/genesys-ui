# Typography.SrOnly

This component renders a hidden, but accessible content, because it's hidden to all devices,
except screen readers.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.SrOnly`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

The content is hidden, but accessible, because it's based in these styles:

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

```css
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  border: 0;
}
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
