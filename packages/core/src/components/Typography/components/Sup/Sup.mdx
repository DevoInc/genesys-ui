# Typography.Sup

This component renders an HTML Superscript element `<sup>`, which specifies
inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical
reasons.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.Sup`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

## As children

Inline typographic components are typically used within other typographic block
components.

They inherit the main text styles from those block components, but they also
have their own inline-specific styles, such as text-decoration, font-weight, and
vertical-align.
