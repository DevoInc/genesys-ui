# Typography.Heading

This component generates HTML headings that serve as titles or
subtitles for various components, such as Panel Header titles, BoxMessage
titles, and Grouping titles in menus and forms.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.Heading`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

To use standard HTML headings (h1-h6) with Typography.Heading, set the type
prop to any 'h-' value. By default, they render as an HTML div. However, it's
possible to render them as any h1 to h6 element by using the 'as' prop. In this example
we render a heading with HTML tag 'h5' instead of the default 'div'.

<Canvas of={Stories.UsingAS} />

## Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Hero

For commercial or on-boarding contexts that require extra-large headings, we can
use any 'hero-' value for the 'type' prop. Here's an example:

<Canvas of={Stories.Hero} />

## Overline

For a subtle heading to group menu items, form fields, and similar items, we can
use any `overline-` value for the 'type' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Overline} />

## Editable heading

<Canvas of={Stories.HeadingEditable} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
