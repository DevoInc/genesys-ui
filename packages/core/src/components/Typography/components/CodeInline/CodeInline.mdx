# Typography.CodeInline

This component displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to
indicate that the text is a short (and inline) fragment of computer code.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.CodeInline`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## As children

Inline typographic components are typically used within other typographic block
components.

They inherit the main text styles from those block components, but they also
have their own inline-specific styles, such as text-decoration, font-weight, and
vertical-align.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
