# Block components

Typographic block components are used either within other components such as
`HelperMessage`, `ValidationMessage`, `FieldLabel`, or as a base for them.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## BlockQuote

`Typography.BlockQuote` renders an HTML Block Quotation Element. It indicates
that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. A URL for the source of the
quotation may be given using the 'cite' attribute.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={BlockQuoteStories.BaseBlockQuote} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={BlockQuoteStories} />

## CodeBlock

`Typography.CodeBlock` displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to
indicate that the text is a fragment of computer code.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={CodeBlockStories.BaseCodeBlock} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={CodeBlockStories} />

## List and List.Item

`Typography.List` component can render an unordered list (by default,
represented as an HTML `<ul>`) or an ordered list (represented as an HTML
`<ol>`). These lists typically display items as bullets or numbered items.

To render a list with `Typography.List`, each child component must be a
`Typography.List.Item`, which renders an HTML `<li>` element.

### List - Basic usage

<Canvas of={ListStories.BaseList} />

### List - API

<ArgTypes of={ListStories} />

### List.Item - Basic usage

<Canvas of={ListItemStories.BaseListItem} />

### List.Item - API

<ArgTypes of={ListItemStories} />

## Paragraph

`Typography.Paragraph` renders an HTML `<p>`. Paragraphs are usually represented
in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines,
although they can be any structural grouping of related content.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.BaseParagraph} />

### Editable

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.ParagraphEditable} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={ParagraphStories} />

## Caption

`Typography.Caption` component is similar to `Paragraph`, but it is intended to
be used for short text blocks. Therefore, by default, it is limited to one line
and the `sm` size prop value.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={CaptionStories.BaseCaption} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={CaptionStories} />

## Lead

The `Typography.Lead` component is designed to be used as a
subtitle or summary block alongside a Heading component.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={LeadStories.BaseLead} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={LeadStories} />

## Heading

`Typography.Heading` component generates HTML headings that serve as titles or
subtitles for various components, such as Panel Header titles, `BoxMessage`
titles, and Grouping titles in menus and forms.

To use standard HTML headings (`h1`-`h6`) with Typography.Heading, set the type
prop to any 'h-' value. By default, they render as an HTML div. However, it's
possible to render them as any `h1` to `h6` element by using the 'as' prop.

### Basic usage

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.BaseHeading} />

### Cases

For commercial or on-boarding contexts that require extra-large headings, we can
use any 'hero-' value for the 'type' prop. Here's an example:

<Source
  code={`<Typography.Heading type={'hero-md'} >Heading</ Typography.Heading>`}
/>

For a subtle heading to group menu items, form fields, and similar items, we can
use any `overline-` value for the 'type' prop.

<Source code={`
<Typography.Heading type={'overline-md'}>
  Heading
</Typography.Heading>
`} />

## Editable heading

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.HeadingEditable} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={HeadingStories} />
