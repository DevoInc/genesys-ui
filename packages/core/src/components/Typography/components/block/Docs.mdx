<Heading.H1>Block components</Heading.H1>

Typographic block components are used either within other components such as `HelperMessage`, `ValidationMessage`, `FieldLabel`, or as a base for them.

<Heading.H2>BlockQuote</Heading.H2>

`Typography.BlockQuote` renders an HTML Block Quotation Element. It indicates that
the enclosed text is an extended quotation. A URL for the source of the quotation
may be given using the 'cite' attribute.

<Heading.H2>List and ListItem</Heading.H2>

`Typography.List` component can render an unordered list (by default, represented as an HTML `<ul>`)
or an ordered list (represented as an HTML `<ol>`). These lists typically display items as bullets or numbered items.

To render a list with `Typography.List`, each child component must be a Typography.ListItem, which renders an HTML `<li>`Ô¨Å element.

in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines,
although they can be any structural grouping of related content.

<Heading.H2>Heading</Heading.H2>

`Typography.Heading` component generates HTML headings that serve
as titles or subtitles for various components, such as Panel Header titles,
BoxMessage titles, and Grouping titles in menus and forms.

To use standard HTML headings (h1-h6) with Typography.Heading,
set the type prop to any 'h-' value. By default, they render as an HTML div.
However, it's possible to render them as any h1 to h6 element by using the 'as' prop.

<Heading.H3>Basic usage</Heading.H3>

<Heading.H3>Cases</Heading.H3>

For commercial or onboarding contexts that require extra-large headings,
we can use any 'hero-' value for the 'type' prop. Here's an example:

<Source
  code={`
<Typography.Heading type={'hero-md'} >Heading</ Typography.Heading>
`}
/>

For a subtle heading to group menu items,
form fields, and similar items, we can use any 'overline-' value for the 'type' prop.

<Source
  code={`
<Typography.Heading type={'overline-md'} >Heading</ Typography.Heading>
`}
/>
