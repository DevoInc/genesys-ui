# Typography.Abbr

This component renders an HTML Abbreviation element (`<abbr>`) which
represents an abbreviation or acronym.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.Abbr`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Tooltip

The optional 'tooltip' prop can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation.
If tooltip is present, it must contain this full description and nothing else.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithTooltip} />

## As children

Inline typographic components are typically used within other typographic block
components.

They inherit the main text styles from those block components, but they also
have their own inline-specific styles, such as text-decoration, font-weight, and
vertical-align.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsChildren} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
