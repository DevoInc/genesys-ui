# Typography.Small

This component renders an HTML `<em>` element which marks text that has
stress emphasis. It can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Typography } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

It's defined with dot notation as `Typography.Small`, because this component belongs to `Typography` group.

## As children

Inline typographic components are typically used within other typographic block
components.

They inherit the main text styles from those block components, but they also
have their own inline-specific styles, such as text-decoration, font-weight, and
vertical-align.
