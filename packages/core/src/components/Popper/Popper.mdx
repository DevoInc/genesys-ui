## [Overview](#overview)

`Popper` is an internal component that positions a container with respect to a
trigger.

To achieve this behavior, it is built with the popular external library
[React Popper](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/).

`Popper` is composed of a trigger and a content.
Trigger is a prop that can be any clickable component built with forwardRef,
while the content is passed as children.

If we talk about the content elevation, the `Popper` component defines the value
of `zIndex` prop of its children. If its own `zIndex` prop is defined, then
the value for its children is set to 'auto', so the elevation is mainly defined
by itself.
