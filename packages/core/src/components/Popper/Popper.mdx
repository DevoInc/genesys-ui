# Popper

## Overview

The Popper component is designed to position a container in relation to a trigger.
This is achieved through the use of the external library `React Popper`.

Popper consists of a trigger and content.
The trigger is a prop that can be any clickable component
built with forwardRef, while the content is passed as a child.

Regarding content elevation, the Popper component determines
the zIndex value of its children.
If its own zIndex prop is defined, the value for its children is set to 'auto',
thereby allowing the elevation to be primarily defined by the component itself.
