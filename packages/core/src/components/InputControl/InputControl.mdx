# InputControl

## Overview

The Input component provides a way for users to enter free-form text data.

It's important to choose the appropriate text field `type` based on the type of content that users are expected to enter.
This ensures that the input is validated and processed correctly.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { InputControl } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Advanced usage

We can get any case of the component using only `InputControl` and its props as in this example with addons and icon:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={casesStories.WithAddonsAndIcons} />

But if we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the component we have its subcomponents
available following dot notation.

- `InputControl.Container`: the outermost container which distributes the addons and the inner container (input and icon).
- `InputControl.Addon`: the content block at the right or/and the left of the inner container.
- `InputControl.InnerContainer`: the inner container which distributes the input and icon.
- `InputControl.Input`: the input control.
- `InputControl.Icon`: the icon which can be a custom/status icon (to the right) or type icon (e.g. the 'magnifying glass' for type search) to the left.

This way, we can get the previous example, but using these subcomponents:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={casesStories.AdvancedUsage} />

## API

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
