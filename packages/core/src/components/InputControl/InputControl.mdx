# InputControl

## Overview

The Input component provides a way for users to enter free-form text data.

It's important to choose the appropriate text field `type` based on the type of content that users are expected to enter.
This ensures that the input is validated and processed correctly.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { InputControl } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Advanced usage

We can get any case of the component using only `InputControl` and its props as in this example with addons and icon:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithAddonsAndIcons} />

But if we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the component we have its internal components
available following dot notation.

- `InputControl._Container`: the outermost container which distributes the addons and the inner container (input and icon).
- `InputControl._Addon`: the content block at the right or/and the left of the inner container.
- `InputControl._InnerContainer`: the inner container which distributes the input and icon.
- `InputControl._Input`: the input control.
- `InputControl._Icon`: the icon which can be a custom/status icon (to the right) or type icon (e.g. the 'magnifying glass' for type search) to the left.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific needs, usually because we need custom styles
for some piece of the component.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.AdvancedUsage} />

## Search type

We can hide the auto-rendered type search icon whe it might be redundant. E.g. when the `InputControl`
is combined with an `IconButton` or a `Button` which they already have the usual search icon.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SearchType} />
