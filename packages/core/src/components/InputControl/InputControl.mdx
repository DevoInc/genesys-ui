# InputControl

The Input component provides a way for users to enter free-form text data.

It's important to choose the appropriate text field `type` based on the type of
content that users are expected to enter.
This ensures that the input is validated and processed correctly.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { InputControl } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Disabled and readonly

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledAndReadonly} />

## Status

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

## With addons

<Canvas of={Stories.WithAddons} />

## With icon

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcon} />

## Search type

We can hide the auto-rendered type search icon whe it might be redundant. E.g.
when the `InputControl` is combined with an `IconButton` or a `Button` which
they already have the usual search icon.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SearchType} />

## Password type

If we select the type password for the `InputControl`, then it's rendered an `IconButton`
floating at the right of the field, which allows to show/hide the password value.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.PasswordType} />

## Other types

These are the types which are not being used in other existing components (as checkbox, radio... etc.)
and they are neither 'search' nor 'password' type, already treated previously.

<Canvas of={Stories.Types} />

## Advanced usage

If we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the
component we have its internal components available following dot notation.

- `InputControl._Container`: the outermost container which distributes the
  addons and the inner container (input and icon).
- `InputControl._Addon`: the content block at the right or/and the left of the
  inner container.
- `InputControl._InnerContainer`: the inner container which distributes the
  input and icon.
- `InputControl._Input`: the input control.
- `InputControl._Icon`: the icon which can be a custom/status icon (to the
  right) or type icon (e.g. the 'magnifying glass' for type search) to the left.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs, usually because we need custom styles for some piece of the component.
