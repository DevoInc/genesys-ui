# Drawer

It's a component based on a resizable and closable panel which slides out from the edge of the screen.
It can be useful when you need users to complete a task or view some details
without leaving the current page.

It's based in the [react-dock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dock) library,
and this is the [demo](https://alexkuz.github.io/react-dock/demo/).

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Drawer } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

As a wrapper of other contents which are its children.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} story={{ height: '60rem' }} />

## Closable

You have to use a `Panel` component with a `Panel.Header` to render the typical
close button at the top-right side of the panel.

<Canvas of={Stories.Closable} story={{ height: '60rem' }} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
