# Loader

## Overview

The **Loader** component informs about a waiting time capturing the user’s
attention while pausing their interaction with the app.

The Loader is composed by the following elements:

- **Overlay**: it is a background (opaque or not) which fills a specific area.
- Element that captures the user’s attention. This can be: **animated logo**,
  **spinner** or **progress bar** (managed with the prop type).

Loader usage patterns have been established that can be grouped into:
**global loading** and **contextual loading**.

- **GlobalLoader**: case always display a fixed dark overlay that takes up the
  whole page and animated logo as loading type. In the case of reseller, the logo
  must be replaced by the spinner. See [case](/?path=/story/public-feedback-loader-cases--global-loader).
- **ContextualLoader**: case is based on a light overlay relative to some
  container and spinner or progress loading types. See [case](/?path=/story/public-feedback-loader-cases--contextual-loader).
