# Loader

## Overview

The `Loader` component serves to notify the user of a waiting period, temporarily halting their interaction with the application.
The `Loader` is comprised of several elements, including an `Overlay` which fills a designated area, and a visually engaging component that captures the user's attention.
This can take the form of an animated logo, spinner, or progress bar (determined by the prop type).

There are established usage patterns for the `Loader`, which fall into two categories: global loading and contextual loading.
