<H2>Overview</H2>

The Loader component serves to notify the user of a waiting period, temporarily halting their interaction with the application.
The Loader is comprised of several elements, including an Overlay which fills a designated area, and a visually engaging component that captures the user's attention.
This can take the form of an animated logo, spinner, or progress bar (determined by the prop type).

There are established usage patterns for the Loader, which fall into two categories: global loading and contextual loading.
