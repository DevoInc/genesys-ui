# Loader

## [Overview](#overview)

The Loader component serves to notify the user of a waiting period, temporarily halting their interaction with the application.
The Loader is comprised of several elements, including an **Overlay** which fills a designated area, and a visually engaging component that captures the user's attention.
This can take the form of an **animated logo**, **spinner**, or **progress bar** (determined by the prop type).

There are established usage patterns for the Loader, which fall into two categories: **global loading** and **contextual loading**.
