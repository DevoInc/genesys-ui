# Popover

This Popover component allows users to expand hidden contents using a trigger,
usually a button, link or menu item.

A dropdown menu variant is a typical way of using this kind of component,
which allows users to select an option from a drop-down menu list.

This component is valuable in web applications to enhance usability by
reducing the amount of screen space used to display options, especially
when there are multiple choices available.

This component is based on [Popper JS library](https://popper.js.org/).

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Popover } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

The `Popover` component must have two children components.
First, the trigger element and right after the content to be displayed.

This content usually should be wrapped by the `Popover.Panel` component,
which provides the elevation styles (box shadow, radius, z-index... etc.)
according to the design pattern.

The trigger component should be involved into a function.
This function will receive the `ref` property, the `toggle`
function, the `setOpened` function and `isOpened` as a boolean
indicating when it's opened. So it can be any clickable component
built with ref.

- `ref`: used to retrieve the React ref of the _popper_ element.
- `toggle`: function to toggle the content of the component.
- `setOpened`: function to force display or hide the Popover floating content.
- `isOpened`: a boolean indicating if the Popover floating content is open.

```jsx
<Popover {...args} id={popoverId}>
  {({ toggle, ref, isOpened }) => (
    <Button
      aria-controls={popoverId}
      aria-expanded={isOpened}
      aria-haspopup={true}
      onClick={toggle}
      ref={ref}
      state={isOpened ? 'expanded' : undefined}
    >
      TriggerElement
    </Button>
  )}
  <Popover.Panel padding="cmp-sm">
    <Typography.Paragraph>
      This is the content of the Popover.
    </Typography.Paragraph>
  </Popover.Panel>
</Popover>
```

## Nested Popover

`Popover` component allows the creation of hierarchical structures,
where one Popover can contain other Popovers as selectable options.

You should add a `offset` modifier to each nested Popover equal to the
`Popover.Panel` padding, so the panel will be rendered at the end
of the content instead of at the end of the trigger.

**IMPORTANT:** to avoid the parent being closed when a nested one is clicked
due to problems with the `ref`, we have to define `appendTo={null}`
in the nested popovers. This way, the first parent container will be appended
by default to the end of the `body`, and the nested ones will be rendered inside
this one.

## Access to state from content

Sometimes you need to access to the Popover state from its content, like when we
use a 'cancel' button or an 'X' close, or when we want the Popover closed
clicking on a children action.

To do that we have to use the 'render-props' technique and include the content
as a function instead of a node.

<Canvas of={Stories.AccessToStateFromContent} />

## On hover

<Canvas of={Stories.OnHover} />

## Arrow

You can add an arrow to the Popover content by the `arrowConfig` prop. It's an
object with these variables:

- `component`: it's a render-props function (depends on placement prop) with the
  component used as arrow. E.g.
  `({ placement }) => <Popover.Arrow placement={placement} />`.
  We have a pre-defined component with the basic needed styles `Popover.Arrow`,
  but anyway you can add a custom one if you need it.
- `padding`: the separation of the arrow from the edge of the content. More info
  in [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/arrow/#padding).
- `size`: the square size of the arrow which will be used to define the `offset`
  of the content.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithArrow} story={{ height: '16rem' }} />

## Disabled outside event

The Popover is closed by default on `click` and `blur` events. Sometimes you
might need to avoid this and delegate the close action only to a specific event
as an inside button click. You only need to use the `disableOutsideEvent`:

<Canvas of={Stories.DisabledOutsideEvent} />

## Accessibility

To ensure full accessibility of the component, we need to consider multiple
aspects. These include:

- Adding a value for the `id` prop of the component. This value is
  automatically mapped to the attribute of the 'div' HTML element which wraps
  the Popover content. This value has to be used as the `aria-controls` prop
  value of the Popover trigger.
- Each trigger component should have defined the `onClick` property to get the
  key events.
- Add to the trigger the `aria-haspopup` prop value to true.
- Add to the trigger the `aria-expanded` prop value to true when the Popover is
  opened.
- Add to the trigger the `aria-controls` prop value with the same value of the
  `id` prop of the component.

## usePopper

In case you require a specific behavior, you can use the hooks offered by the
library directly in your code. You can refer to the documentation of
[React Popper](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/) for further details.

Below is a brief example showcasing its use:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { usePopper } from 'react-popper';

const Example = () => {
  const [referenceElement, setReferenceElement] = React.useState(null);
  const [popperElement, setPopperElement] = React.useState(null);
  const [arrowElement, setArrowElement] = React.useState(null);
  const { styles, attributes } = usePopper(referenceElement, popperElement, {
    modifiers: [{ name: 'arrow', options: { element: arrowElement } }],
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" ref={setReferenceElement}>
        Reference element
      </button>
      <div ref={setPopperElement} style={styles.popper} {...attributes.popper}>
        Popper element
        <div ref={setArrowElement} style={styles.arrow} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```
