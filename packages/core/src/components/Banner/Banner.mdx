# Banner

## Overview

Component designed to display a message or notification to the user, with
customizable content, title, and status.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Banner } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## With actions

You can add actions at the end of the `Banner` adding the `actions` prop. This
prop admits a React node, but we recommend to use the `Banner.Action` or the
`Banner.SubtleAction` if it's the subtle variant, because they inherit
automatically some props from their parent.

For instance, we have here two actions: one which inherits the `colorScheme`
from the `status` of the parent, and another one which specifies its own
`colorScheme`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Actions} />

## Subtle variant

This is a variant for the `Banner` component when you need to use it in small
contexts or for not an important and/or temporary message. This variant implies
less size, spacing, less heavy background-color, content and actions in a unique
line... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Subtle} />

## Removable using cookie

You can make the `Banner` removable, based on cookies, using the `close` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Cookie} />

## Custom usage

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the
component and its props.
In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define
that specific usage.
We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs.

The `Banner._Icon` and the `Banner._Actions` inherit automatically the `status`
prop from its parent `Banner._Container` by context.

## Props
