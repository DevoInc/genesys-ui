# Banner

## Overview

Component designed to display a message or notification to the user, with customizable content, title, and status.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Banner } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Removable using cookie

You can make the `Banner` removable, based on cookies, using the `close` prop.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Cookie} />

### Custom

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the component and its props.
In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define that specific usage.
We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific needs.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Custom} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
