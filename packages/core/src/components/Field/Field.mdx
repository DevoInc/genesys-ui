# Field

## Overview

Component designed to wrap form controls such as Input, Select, Checkbox, and Textarea, providing additional functionality such as labeling, helper messages, and validation messages.
It also manages the layout and distribution of these elements within the field control.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Field } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Advanced usage

We can get any case of the component using only `Field` and its props as in this example with an Input, label and helper:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={casesStories.BasicUsageWithHelper} />

But if we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the component we have its subcomponents
available following dot notation:

- `Field._Container`: the outermost container which distributes the field control (control, label and floating validation) and the helper.
- `Field._LabelDistributor`: the container which distributes the inner field control and the label.
- `Field._ControlDistributor`: the container which distributes the child field control and the floating validation. It also controls the width. Here it's included the FloatingHelper if the Label is hidden.
- `Field._Label`: The label content. Here it's included the FloatingHelper by its 'helper' prop if the Label is not hidden. Here it's included the RequiredMark by its 'requiredMark' prop if the field is mandatory.
- `Field._RequiredMark`: The marker to indicate that the field is required or mandatory.
- `Field._Helper`: The helper message to help the user to fill the field or for the validation message.
- `Field._FloatingHelper`: The Helper, but displayed as a floating InlineMessage.

This way, we can get the previous example, but using these subcomponents:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={casesStories.AdvancedUsage} />

These are two examples of advanced usage, but with validation:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={casesStories.AdvancedUsageWithValidation} />

<Canvas
  sourceState="shown"
  of={casesStories.AdvancedUsageWithFloatingValidation}
/>

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
