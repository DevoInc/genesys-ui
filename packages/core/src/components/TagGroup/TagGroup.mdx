# TagGroup

## Overview

The TagGroup component is used to group and display multiple
Tag components together in a horizontal layout.
It is useful when displaying multiple tags related to a certain item or
category.

The TagGroup component takes care of aligning the tags and
providing a consistent look and feel across all of them.
It also provides the ability to set a label for the group and adjust the size
of the tags.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { TagGroup } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There is a pre-defined component called `TagGroup.Tag` to be used as children
of a `TagGroup`.
It is a simple wrapper of the `Tag` component which is able to inherit some
props automatically from its parent by a React context: size, quiet,
colorScheme... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

We recommend to use this component, but anyway you can use also a `Tag`
component.

Anyway, when we talk about inheriting props from its parent, they are
overwritten when we define that prop directly on the child.

You can use `Tag` as children instead of the pre-defined `TagGroup.Tag`,
but it's not able to read the parent context, so it can't inherit the
`colorScheme`, `size`... etc. prop values.

In this example the `TagGroup` parent has 'error' `colorScheme`, but the
children are not inheriting this value:

<Canvas of={Stories.UseOfTag} />

## As legend

If you apply the `quiet` prop to the `TagGroup` parent, then you get a group of
tags as a legend.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsLegend} />

## With label

You can add a label to the `TagGroup` to add more context to the group. If this
prop value is type string, then automatically it's added as `aria-label` value
to the group.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithLabel} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
