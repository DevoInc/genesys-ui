# Icon

Component used to display an icon associated with different states or actions.
It can be used as a standalone component or as a child of another component.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Icon } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

You have to use the `Icon` component as a wrapper of a React component from
`@devoinc/genesys-icons`, as `<GIActivity />`, `<GIAngleDown />`... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Predefined Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Predefined color schemes and custom color

The first group are examples of pre-defined 'colorScheme' prop values and the second one to the right is using
the 'color' prop which allows to assign any desired color.

<Canvas of={Stories.ColorSchemes} />

## Overwriting props

This wrapper `Icon` use a context which applies default styles based in props,
so we can get easily the most used sizes, the tokenized colors... etc. but
eventually they can be overwritten in the own child component from
`@devoinc/genesys-icons`:

<Canvas of={Stories.OverwritingProps} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
