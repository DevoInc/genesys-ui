# Badge

## Overview

Component used to display a small piece of information, either as icon or text.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Badge } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

The `Badge` usually is a complement of other functional component as `Button`, `Menu.Item`... etc.
communicating that something affects to that entity or adding info about states.

<Canvas of={Stories.InOtherComponents} sourceState="none" />

## Content schemes

We can define a `Badge` with three different content schemes:

- **Empty**: it has no content and it's a bullet as a circle.
- **Icon**: it has an icon as content, and it's a bullet with square aspect ratio.
- **Text**: it has text as content, and it's a bullet with square aspect ratio if the text does not
  have more than one character.

The badge can't have icon and text at the same time. If both are defined, only te text is rendered.

<Canvas of={Stories.ContentSchemes} />

## Custom usage

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the components and its props.
In these cases, you can use its Internal components (`_` notation) to define that specific usage. We don't
recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific needs.

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />
