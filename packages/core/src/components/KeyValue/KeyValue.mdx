# KeyValue

## Overview

It's an easy way to represent any type of data: new alerts, new messages, number
of visits, temperature... etc. with a key-value format.

Useful when we need to represent data in a structured way, associate a key with
a value or when we need to draw attention to some short info.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { KeyValue } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This is an example of a canonical usage with data based in key-value format:

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

But not always is strictly a key-value data. For instance, sometimes you want to
use this component to represent a data with format title-description as in this
info message:

<Canvas of={Stories.TitleDescription} />

## Supporting visual

We can add a visual supporting at the beginning of the component by
`SupportingVisual` prop. This prop expects a `React.Reactnode`, so we can use
almost any content, but typically we will use three types of content:

- Icon react component from genesys-icons library as `<GIUserRoleAdmin />`,
  `<GIWeatherSunSummer>`... etc. They get automatically the perfect size
  inheriting the size from the component context.
- HTML image which can link to an image (jpg, png... etc.) or SVG code. In this
  case you must define the width and height, because it doesn't inherit form the
  context. These values must be 36-40px to adjust to the height of the content
  block with 'base' format or 24-28px with 'row' one.
- Any other visual component of the library as `Avatar`, `Thumbnail`, `Icon`...
  etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.SupportingVisual} />

## With unit

It's possible to add a unit at the end fo the value block which is very useful
when we talk about data volume (Gb), temperature (ÂºC), money ($)... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithUnit} />

## Defining which is the bold content

Sometimes you want to highlight the key, but other times you want to highlight
the value, depending on which block you want to draw the attention to. Usually
the value is highlighted when is auto-explained, as in name, description,
temperature, state... etc. Then you can use the `boldContent` prop ('key' by
default) to define the value as the bold content.

<Canvas of={Stories.BoldContent} />

## Inverting order

Anyway, sometimes you might need to draw the attention to the value, in spite of
it's not auto-explained, maybe because it's a recurrent data info which the user
read a lot of times, then you can also invert the order of the blocks with the
`invertOrder` prop. Usually if this prop is 'true' it's accompanied by 'value'
`boldContent` prop value.

<Canvas of={Stories.InvertedOrder} />

## Custom usage

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the
components and its props. In these cases, you can use its Internal components
(`_` notation) to define that specific usage. We don't recommend this usage, but
anyway it's available for very specific needs.
