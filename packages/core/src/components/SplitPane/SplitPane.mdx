## [Overview](#overview)

The SplitPane component is a layout element that enables the division of the screen into multiple panes.
With SplitPane, you can easily create a split view layout, allowing users to view multiple pieces of content simultaneously.

It can also be nested, allowing for the creation of more complex layouts, and split vertically or horizontally, depending on the needs of the user interface.
