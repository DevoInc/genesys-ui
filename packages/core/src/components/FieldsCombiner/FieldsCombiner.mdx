# FieldsCombiner

Component used to create complex form block layouts by combining different
types of form fields in a single row. It provides customization options to control the appearance and behavior of the
combined fields.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { FieldsCombiner } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

There are a pre-defined components to be used as `FieldsCombiner` pieces. You
should not use another kind of component to do that, and you only are able to
combine two of them.
These components are wrappers of the form ones to apply custom styles and
behavior, so the visual integration is as accurate as possible:

- `FieldsCombiner.Input`: it's the wrapper for the `InputControl.Input`
  component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Select`: it's the wrapper for the `SelectControl` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Button`: it's the wrapper for the `Button` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.IconButton`: it's the wrapper for the `IconButton` component.
- `FieldsCombiner.Checkbox`: it's the wrapper for the `CheckboxControl`
  component.

These components allow to add custom styles and some layout props as `width` to
the original components.

There are multiple combinations of the form fields, but these are the most
usual:

## Button and Popover

When we add a Popover as a piece of the `FieldsCombiner` we only have to use
the `FieldsCombiner.Button` or `FieldsCombiner.IconButton` as the trigger:

<Canvas of={Stories.ButtonAndPopover} />

## Input and Button or IconButton

By default, the field fills all the space available and the button only the
necessary.
Anyway, you can use the `width` prop available in every pre-defined child
component.

<Canvas of={Stories.InputAndButton} />

<Canvas of={Stories.InputAndIconButton} />

## Input and Checkbox

<Canvas of={Stories.InputAndCheckbox} />

## Select and Input with custom widths

By default, the fields fill all the space available, but you can use the `width`
prop available in every pre-defined child component to distribute them in a
custom way.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomWidths} />

## Validation

You only have to add the desired validation status to the `FieldsCombiner`
component and its children will inherit it automatically. In addition, for
accessibility reasons you always have to add a validation message by the
`helper` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithValidation} />
