# Panel

## Overview

The `Panel` component is a container element that provides a bordered layout for displaying various types of content, such as text, lists, tables, and more.
It also allows for customization of its header and footer, which can be used to display titles, icons, or other relevant information.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Panel } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There are three pre-defined components to create a `Panel` with content:

- `Panel.Header`: the header of the panel with the title, subtitle, icon, actions, close button... etc.
- `Panel.Body`: the scrollable wrapper for the panel content.
- `Panel.Footer`: the optional content to be included at the end of the panel,
  where usually are the main actions or the contextual help.

## Closable

## Backward navigation

## Without header or footer
