# Panel

## Overview

The `Panel` component is a container element that provides a bordered layout for
displaying various types of content, such as text, lists, tables, and more.
It also allows for customization of its header and footer, which can be used to
display titles, icons, or other relevant information.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Panel } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There are three pre-defined components to create a `Panel` with content:

- `Panel.Header`: the header of the panel with the title, subtitle, icon, actions, close button... etc.
- `Panel.Body`: the scrollable wrapper for the panel content. If you only add plain text, it will be formatted
  automatically as a `Typography.Paragraph`. But if you need more than one block or something else, then you have to use
  specific components.
- `Panel.Footer`: the optional content to be included at the end of the panel, where usually are the main actions
  or the contextual help.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

The next one is an example with many configuration options defined: icon on the header, subtitle, actions,
help and actions in the footer... etc.

In addition, we can see how the component automatically adds some styles when there is scroll
on the body: box shadow for header and footer and some extra space in the body area.

<Canvas of={Stories.Complex} />

## Closable

You can add a closable control at the end of the `Panel.Header` adding the `closeSettings` prop to that component.
If you need more info about this prop you can find it in [PanelHeader story](?path=/story/components-layout-panel-components--header).

<Canvas of={Stories.Closable} />

## With filter

A typical usage of a Panel is rendering a list which can be filtered form the header area. To do this we need to add two
consecutive `Panel.Header` components: one which is actually the header and other which is the filter area and whose
HTML tag therefore should not be a 'header' one.

The second one with the filter has defined its 'paddingTop' to '0' to avoid too much space between both headers.
In addition, we set 'bordered' to 'true' to get the separator between header and body, and we have to set 'hasBoxShadow'
to 'false' in the first header to avoid get automatically the box shadow styles when there is scroll on the `Panel.Body`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Filterable} />

## Backward navigation

Sometimes the `Panel` is navigable, and we need a link to go back in the navigation or state. We can add the link/button
to the right of the header if we don't have any other element, but usually is located in the left area.

<Canvas of={Stories.BackwardNavigation} />

## Without header or footer

For example, a panel which is used to create a floating panel, and has 'activated' elevation:

<Canvas of={Stories.OnlyContent} />
