# Panel.Header

Header of the `Panel` component, defined with dot notation as `Panel.Header`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Panel` or `Panel` based component.

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

The next one is an example with many configuration options defined: icon, subtitle, actions, close button... etc.

## With actions

Sometimes you need to add some actions for the `Panel` as copy, expand, more options menu... etc. so you only have to
define an array of buttons (usually `IconButtons`), but you have to keep in mind some design patterns:

- The 'colorScheme' value for the buttons should be 'quiet', reducing the noise and adding white space to the block.
  In very specific cases, if you use a `Button` instead of an `IconButton`, then you might apply other 'colorScheme',
  but only if it's needed due to the hierarchy.
- The 'size' for the buttons should be one step less than of the `Panel`. E.g. if the `Panel` has a 'sm' value,
  then the `IconButton` should have a 'xs' one.
- If there is close button, this has to be the last of the actions block located on the right.

## Collapse

This is a configuration prop which is usually used to controls if the `Panel.Body` content is collapsed or not.

## With legend

You can add a `ReactNode` block just to the right of the heading. If you add only plain text, it will be formatted
automatically as a `Typography.Paragraph` with 'weak' styles, but you also add HTML, another component... etc.

## Append and prepend content

You can add a custom `ReactNode` block before of the heading ('prependContent' prop) or after it and before the actions
('appendContent' prop).

<Canvas of={Stories.AppendAndPrepend} />

## Bottom content

You can add a custom `ReactNode` block below of all the header content. For instance, an input as a filter
of the panel content.

<Canvas of={Stories.BottomContent} />

## Navigation content

You can add a custom `ReactNode` block or function that returns that, below all the header, which fills the whole space
and is not affected by the parent container padding. Usually it's a navigation component: Tabs, Steps... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.NavigationContent} />

## Help link block

You can add a help link just after the heading with the 'helpUrl' prop, and to it a tooltip with the 'helpTooltip' one.
The design pattern defines that the hep link must be located at the left of the footer, but if there is no footer or
the content of the footer doesn't allow to include this help block, then we can add it to the header.

<Canvas of={Stories.Help} />

## Custom content using children

If you need a very specific content for the panel header, then you can add directly the content with children prop.
Anyway, there are several internal components available for the header with the `_` prefix, which in fact are used
internally in the `Panel.Header` component, so you can combine these with other components if you need. The `_` prefix
in components means that they were not created only for composition, but they might be used eventually for that purpose,
but only in very specific cases.

- `Panel.Header._Actions`
- `Panel.Header._Close`
- `Panel.Header._CollapseButton`
- `Panel.Header._Container`
- `Panel.Header._Heading`
- `Panel.Header._Icon`
- `Panel.Header._Navigation`
