# Panel.Footer

Footer of the `Panel` component, defined with dot notation as `Panel.Footer`. This component should be used only as a
child of a `Panel` or `Panel` based component.

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## With actions

The actions of a footer always should be `Button` components and maintain the hierarchy order: the most emphasized
should be located the last one, therefore most at the right.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithActions} />

## Custom content using children

If you need a very specific content for the panel footer, then you can add directly the content with children prop.
Anyway, there are several internal components available for the header with the `_` prefix, which in fact are used
internally in the `Panel.Footer` component, so you can combine these with other components if you need. The `_` prefix
in components means that they were not created only for composition, but they might be used eventually for that purpose,
but only in very specific cases.

- `Panel.Footer._Actions`
- `Panel.Footer._Container`
- `Panel.Footer._Help`

<Canvas of={Stories.Children} />
