# Collapse

## Overview

Collapsible container that hides or reveals its `children` on demand.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Collapse } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

You have to use the `Collapse` component as a trigger of other hidden component
or block. Usually, we use a `React.useState` to manage if the content is hidden
or not:

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Custom based in internal components

Sometimes you need something very specific, which is not possible using only the
component and its props.
In these cases, you can use its internal components (`_` notation) to define
that specific usage.
We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs, usually about styles.

<Canvas of={Stories.Custom} />

## Accessibility

You have to add the `aria-controls` prop to the `Collapse` component, and it has
to be equal to the `id` prop/attribute of the collapsed content. The
`aria-expanded` prop is also required for the trigger by accessibility, but it's
added automatically based in the `expanded` prop.
You can see it in this example:

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
