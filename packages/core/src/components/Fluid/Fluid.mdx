# Fluid

The Fluid components (Container, Row, and Col) are part of a layout system and
are used to create responsive, flexible layouts.

- **Container** acts as a wrapper that centers its child elements horizontally and
  sets a maximum width for them. In addition, it defines the gutter between the
  cols.
- **Row** is a container for a group of Col components and defines a horizontal row.
- **Col** is a component that defines a column within a Row.

These components are based in the **React Grid System** library, so you can find
more info in its [Documentation page](https://sealninja.github.io/react-grid-system/).

See below for more details about our components, because they are not identical
to the library ones.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Container, Row, Col } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Equal width

If you don't assign any distribution prop to the `Col` components, then each one
fills the same space.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.EqualWidth} />

## Stacked to horizontal

Resize your browser or load on different devices to test the grid system.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.Stacked} />

## Column wrapping

If the sum of the widths of the columns is greater than the col numbers defined
in the main configuration (by default 12), then the last column gets wrapped
onto a new line as one contiguous unit.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.ColumnWrapping} />

## Vertical alignment

<Canvas of={CasesStories.VerticalAlignment} />

## Horizontal alignment

<Canvas of={CasesStories.HorizontalAlignment} />

## Direction prop for order and orientation

<Canvas of={CasesStories.Order} />

## Offsetting

<Canvas of={CasesStories.Offsetting} />

## Nesting columns

<Canvas of={CasesStories.NestingColumns} />

## Column width adapted to content

If you want that one of the columns get its width based in its own content, you
only need to assign 'content' value to any of the breakpoints (xs, sm, md...
etc.) to define the width.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.AdaptedContent} />

## Gutter definition by Container

You should define the 'gutter' prop by the `Container` parent component, because
it's better that all the child `Row` components inherit the same gutter from its
parent. The parent container automatically assigns the necessary props to the
`Row` and `Col` components to get a group with the adjusted margins and
paddings.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.GutterDefinition} />

## Gutter definition by each Row

Anyway you can define a specific 'gutter' in the `Row` component level, but the
padding of the parent `Container` won't adjust to all the rows.

<Canvas of={CasesStories.GutterDefinitionByRow} />
