## [Overview](#overview)

The Fluid components (Container, Row, and Col) are part of a layout system and are used to create responsive, flexible layouts.

- Container acts as a wrapper that centers its child elements horizontally and sets a maximum width for them.
- Row is a container for a group of Col components and defines a horizontal row.
- Col is a component that defines a column within a Row.

See below for more details.
