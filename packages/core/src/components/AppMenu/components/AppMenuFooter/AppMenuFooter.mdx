# AppMenu.Footer

This component is used to define the menu footer of the AppMenu component,
where it's usually located the collapse trigger.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { AppMenu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is defined with dot notation as `AppMenu.Footer` and it should be a child of a `AppMenu` component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Custom content

If you define the 'children' prop for the component, then the content only depends on that prop,
so you can totally control the rendered components.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomContent} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
