# AppMenu.PopoverItem

This component is used to define the AppMenu popover submenu items. This menu
item has specific props to render a featured icon, a description...etc. and
it has an actions block which is only visible while hovering.

This is a component based on the [Menu.Item](?path=/docs/components-navigation-menu-components-menuitem-overview--overview&globals=theme:light)
component, so it has almost the same props as it.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { AppMenu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is defined with dot notation as `AppMenu.PopoverItem` and it should be a child of a `AppMenu` component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Simple with actions

This is an example of the component with a label and a block of actions, in this case only one. This actions block is
only rendered while hovering to reduce the noise if there are many similar items in the group.

<Canvas of={Stories.SimpleWithActions} />

## With description and featured icon
