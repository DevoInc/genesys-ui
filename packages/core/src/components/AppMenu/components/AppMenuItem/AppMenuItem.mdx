# AppMenu.Item

This component is used to define each interactive and actionable AppMenu item.

This is a component based on the [Menu.Item](?path=/docs/components-navigation-menu-components-menuitem-overview--overview&globals=theme:light)
component, so it has almost the same props as it. Anyway, it adds some new props as 'counter', 'isBeta'... etc.
which we will see below.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { AppMenu } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

This component is defined with dot notation as `AppMenu.Item` and it should be a child of a `AppMenu` component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Expandable

In this component, the expandable mark is different from the MenuItem component.

<Canvas of={Stories.Expandable} />

## Counter

In this component, we can add a counter badge to be added next to the icon.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithCounter} />

## Beta

In this component, we have a specific prop to add a 'beta' mark.

<Canvas of={Stories.IsBeta} />

## Active

The state prop, in this case, is used to mark the current section ('active') or the expanded one ('expanded').
The rest of the available values of this prop are less common in this context.

<Canvas of={Stories.Active} />

## Tooltip

If you define the 'tooltip' prop, its behavior here is different from the MenuItem component, so it's only visible
when the component is collapsed and while hovering, and it has a more prominent look & feel.

<Canvas of={Stories.Tooltip} />
