# InlineMessage

## Overview

Component designed to position a container in relation to a trigger.
It uses the
[Popover component](?path=/docs/components-core-navigation-popover--docs) under
the hood.

It's usually used to display contextual floating help and status info, without
reducing the amount of screen space.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## How to import

<Source code={`import { InlineMessage } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

The `InlineMessage` component must have one children component which will be the
floating content to be displayed by a trigger.

This trigger is an `IconButtonStatus` by default, and it can be modified using
the `trigger` prop, even adding some text to the default icon button.

<Source of={Stories.Base} />

## `InlineMessage.Panel`

One of the most frequent use of the `InlineMessage` component is to include an
`InlineMessage.Panel` as a child.
This component uses `Panel` components as base, but adding some styles and
default prop values.

<Source of={Stories.WithPanel} />

## Custom trigger

The default trigger is an `IconButtonStatus` but you can define a custom one by
the `trigger.Component` prop.

<Source of={Stories.CustomTrigger} />

## Banner

Another atypical use of the `InlineMessage` component is to include an
`InlineMessage.Banner` as a child.
This is a case with docked banners as the content of the `InlineMessage`.

<Source of={Stories.Banner} />
