# InlineMessage

## Overview

`InlineMessage` is a component that positions a container with respect to a
trigger. To achieve this behavior, it is built internally with the new component
[Popper](/?path=/story/internal-atoms-popper--example).

- The **container** has a custom style with a colored arrow and border based on
  the prop status.
- The **trigger** is set by default like an ActionStatus taking into account the
  prop status. Furthermore, the trigger can have a title and a subtitle.

**Status** can be: base, success, warning, error, help and info.

If you want to use base status, you have to use a custom **trigger** with the
prop trigger because ActionStatus with base status does not exist. Trigger can
be any clickable component built with forwardRef.

The **content** is passed as children.
