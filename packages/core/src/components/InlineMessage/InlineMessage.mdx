# InlineMessage

Component designed to render an inline message floating in relation to a trigger.

It uses the [Popover component](?path=/docs/components-core-navigation-popover--docs) under the hood.

It's usually used to display contextual floating help and status info, without
reducing the amount of screen space.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## How to import

<Source code={`import { InlineMessage } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

The `InlineMessage` component must have one children component which will be the
floating content to be displayed by a trigger.

This trigger is an `IconButtonStatus` by default, and it can be modified using
the `trigger` prop, even adding some text to the default icon button.

<Source of={Stories.Playground} />

## InlineMessage.Panel

One of the most frequent use of the `InlineMessage` component is to include an
`InlineMessage.Panel` as a child.

This component uses `Panel` components as base, but adding some styles and
default prop values.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithPanel} />

## Trigger with text

The default trigger is an `IconButtonStatus` but if you add the 'text' and 'secondaryText' to the 'trigger' prop
configuration, then you get a textual trigger.

<Canvas of={Stories.TriggerWithText} />

## Custom trigger

The default trigger is an `IconButtonStatus` but you can define a custom one by
the `trigger.Component` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomTrigger} />

## Banner

Another atypical use of the `InlineMessage` component is to include an
`InlineMessage.Banner` as a child.

This is a case with docked banners as the content of the `InlineMessage`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Banner} />
