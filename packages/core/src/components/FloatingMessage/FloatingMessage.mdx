# FloatingMessage

## Overview

Component that provides a floating message to inform the user about a particular
task or process.
Usually is used to provide feedback to the user once an action or event is
launched.

For instance, a floating message which is rendered when a user copies/pastes a
content, informing about the result of the action: if it's been successful or
not. Or a message displayed in a code editor when the format is not valid.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { FloatingMessage } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Positioned relative to its parent

The component position is based in an absolute way, so for working properly is
needed a parent container with position relative or absolute. This is an example
with a position relative paretn container and with a code block as sibling of
the component.
The floating message is positioned in an absolute way, but relative to this
sibling thanks to the common parent with position relative:

<Canvas of={Stories.PositionedToItsParent} />

## Position demo

This is an example of all the available position values. There is an offset by
default based in the position value to get the correct location of the message,
so although it's not visible in the example code or in the prop value it exists,
and it's being applied.

<Canvas of={Stories.Position} />
