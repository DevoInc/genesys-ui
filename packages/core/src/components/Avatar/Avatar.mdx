# [Avatar](#avatar)

## [Overview](#overview)

Component to display a visual representation of a user or an entity, typically in the form of a profile image or initials.

## [How to import](#how-to-import)

<Source
  code={`
import { Avatar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## [Basic usage](#basic-usage)

The simplest way to use Avatar is to pass a URL for the image:

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## [Cases](#cases)

### [Custom size](#custom-size)

We can use a custom size for our Avatar using the `customSize` prop. We have to
use an object to define the width and the height of the Avatar.

Using the _square_ variable we get the same value for width
and height:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.CustomSizeSquare} />

Using _width_ and/or _height_ we get the specific value for each one:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.CustomSizeSpecificSize} />

If we use only one of the specific values (_width_ or _height_), then the other one
is defined by the prop `size`.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.CustomSizeOnlyOne} />

### [Using Svg](#using-svg)

We can use a svg file at the same way as an image. If the svg has a not squared
aspect ratio, then we have to define a `customSize` to fit to the edges.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.CustomSizeSVG} />

### [Adding badge](#adding-badge)

We can add a _badge_ block over the _Avatar_. In this example we use a `Badge`
component, but it's possible to use any node or component. You have to take into
account that the _badge_ block is positioned related to the Avatar, assuming the
approximate size of a `Badge` component.

With text content:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithBadgeText} />

With icon content:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithBadgeIcon} />

As a bubble with no content and specific `colorScheme`:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithBadgeCustomColor} />

### [Initials instead of image](#initials-instead of image)

If we use a 'no image' version of _Avatar_, then the `initials` are visible.
The maximum number of characters is two. There is a prop to define specific ones,
but anyway they are auto-generated by default from the required `name` prop:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.InitialsInsteadImage} />

### [Using colorScheme prop](#using-colorscheme-prop)

The use of `colorScheme` in Avatar components is visible if we use a 'no image'
version, so the `initials` are rendered.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.WithColorScheme} />

### [As button](#as-button)

By defining the _onClick_ property, the avatar behaves as a button.

Clickable as a button which would open a Modal to edit the profile:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.ButtonEditable} />

Clickable as a button which would open a Lightbox to expand the image:

<Canvas of={CaseStories.ButtonExpandable} />

### [Clickable](#clickable)

You can use the Avatar as a clickable element. E.g. when it opens a Modal (button)
or when it allows navigating to another page (link).

To get the clickable behavior and the related visual styles you have to define at
least one of the `onClick` or the `href` props.

Related with the clickable version you can use the `aria-` props related with
accessibility reasons: `aria-controls` (id of the controlled component),
`aria-expanded` (if the controlled component is opened) and `aria-haspopup`
(if the controlled component is a pop-up and what kind of).

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Clickable} />

### [As Link](#as-link)

By defining the _href_ property, the avatar behaves as a link. Additionally, it is possible
to set the _target_ mode for the URL to open.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.Link} />

## [API](#api)

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
