# ChipGroup

## Overview

Component that groups together multiple Chip components and provides additional functionality and styling.
This can be useful when presenting a set of related options or for allowing users to select multiple items from a list.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Badge } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Multiple selection

When multiple selection is needed (form checkboxes behavior), you can use the ChipGroup component to
get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelection} />

### Single selection

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), you can add the selectionScheme prop to 'single' and assign
the name prop with the same value to every Chip to get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.SingleSelection} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
