# ChipGroup

## Overview

Input elements of type checkbox are rendered by default as boxes that are checked (ticked) when activated.
A checkbox allows you to select single values for submission in a form (or not).

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Badge } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Multiple selection

When multiple selection is used (form checkboxes behavior) you will get a controlled
ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleSelection} />

## Single selection

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), then you have to
add the `selectionScheme` prop to 'single' and assign the prop `name`
with the same value to every Chip. This way you will get a controlled
ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleSelection} />
