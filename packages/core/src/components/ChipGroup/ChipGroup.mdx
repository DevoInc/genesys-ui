# ChipGroup

## Overview

This is a container for an group of `Chip` component.

## How to import

<Source
  code={`
import { Badge } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';
`}
/>

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

## Cases

### Multiple selection

When multiple selection is used (form checkboxes behavior) you will get a controlled
ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelection} />

### Single selection

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), then you have to
add the `selectionScheme` prop to 'single' and assign the prop `name`
with the same value to every Chip. This way you will get a controlled
ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.SingleSelection} />
