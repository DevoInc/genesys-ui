<Heading.H3>Multiple selection</Heading.H3>

When multiple selection is needed (form checkboxes behavior), you can use the ChipGroup component to
get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelection} />

<Heading.H3>Single selection</Heading.H3>

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), you can add the selectionScheme prop to 'single' and assign
the name prop with the same value to every Chip to get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.SingleSelection} />
