### Multiple selection

ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={CaseStories.MultipleSelection} />

### Single selection

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), then you have to
add the `selectionScheme` prop to 'single' and assign the prop `name`
with the same value to every Chip. This way you will get a controlled
ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.
