# ChipGroup

## Overview

Component that groups together multiple Chip components and provides additional functionality and styling.
This can be useful when presenting a set of related options or for allowing users to select multiple items from a list.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Badge } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

There is a pre-defined component called `ChipGroup.Chip` to be used as children of a `ChipGroup`.
It is a simple wrapper of the `Chip`component which is able to inherit some props automatically
from its parent by a React context: size, selectionScheme, name... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Base} />

We recommend to use this component, but anyway you can use also a `Chip` component.

Anyway, when we talk about inheriting props from its parent, they are overwritten when we define that prop
directly on the child.

## Using not pre-defined ChipGroup components

You can use `Chip` as children instead of the pre-defined `ChipGroup.Chip`,
but it's not able to read the parent context, so it can't inherit the `selectionScheme`, `size`... etc. prop values.

In this example the `ChipGroup` parent has 'xs' `size`, but the children are not inheriting this value:

<Canvas of={Stories.UseOfChip} />

## Cases

### Multiple selection

When multiple selection is needed (form checkboxes behavior), you can use the ChipGroup component to
get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form checkbox inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.MultipleSelection} />

### Single selection

When a single selection is needed (form radios behavior), you can add the selectionScheme prop to 'single' and assign
the name prop with the same value to every Chip to get a controlled ChipGroup with rendered form radio inputs as HTML and their keyboard utility.

<Canvas of={Stories.SingleSelection} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />
