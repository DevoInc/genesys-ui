# UserInfo

It's an easy way to represent the info about a user: name, avatar, email, role... etc.
with pre-defined and custom info blocks.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { UserInfo } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

This component is usually used to extend the info about a user, for example when you're hovering a table cell with
a username and the complete info about the user is shown in a popover.

The main component is only a wrapper which distributes the internal components. You can use any of these isolated
without the main parent component.

These are the two pre-defined components to create a `UserInfo` with content:

- `UserInfo.Avatar`: the avatar block with the essential info: avatar, name and subtitle. Sometimes this component
  can be used as the trigger to show the complete info, for instance with a popover.
- `UserInfo.Details`: the details block with all the detailed info as role, email, job... etc. and another extra custom
  blocks defined with the 'customInfo' prop.

## UserInfo.Avatar

You can get only the essential user info using the internal component `UserInfo.Avatar`.
You can get more information about this component in [its own story](?path=/docs/components-feedback-userinfo-components-userinfoavatar-overview--overview).

<Canvas of={Stories.Avatar} />

## UserInfo.Details

You can get the detailed user info using the internal component `UserInfo.Details`.
You can get more information about this component in [its own story](?path=/docs/components-feedback-userinfo-components-userinfodetails-overview--overview).

<Canvas of={Stories.Details} />

## As Panel

You can use the `UserInfo.Avatar` as the Header of the 'Panel' and the `UserInfo.Details` with the detailed user info
as the content of the body. In addition, we can add a footer with an action related with the user.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsPanel} />

## As Popover

You can use the `UserInfo.Avatar` as a trigger of a popover, which will show the detailed info in a 'Panel' as of the
previous example.

<Canvas of={Stories.AsPopover} />
