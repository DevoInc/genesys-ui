# UserInfo.Details

The extended info of the 'UserInfo' component rendered with a list of an icon-key-value blocks.
It's usually used to give information about the role, job-position, email, phone...

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `UserInfo.Details`, it's usually used as a child of a `UserInfo`
but only when accompanied by a `UserInfo.Avatar`, so you can use it also isolated.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Custom info

There are several pre-defined info blocks which are the most often used ones, but you can add more custom blocks with
the same icon-key-value format with the 'customInfo' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomInfo} />

## With keys

Sometimes it might be useful adding keys to every info block, for instance when the icon and/or the value
are not enough descriptive by themselves.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithKeys} />
