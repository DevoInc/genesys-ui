# UserInfo.Avatar

Essential info of the 'UserInfo' component composed by an Avatar and text content.

## Basic usage

Defined with dot notation as `UserInfo.Avatar`, it's usually used as a child of a `UserInfo`
but only when accompanied by a `UserInfo.Details`, so you can use it also isolated.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

This is the variant with the subtitle. We automatically get a greater size for the avatar to better adjustment,
but anyway you can always set a specific size with the 'avatarSize' prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithSubtitle} />

## With avatar image

The 'avatar' component gets the initials from the required 'name' prop, but anyway you can set an avatar image
with the 'avatar' prop:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithImage} />

## Formats

We have three different formats available which affects to the avatar size and typographic styles:

<Canvas of={Stories.Formats} />

Anyway, when the subtitle is set, then the format is automatically set to 'bold' variant:

<Canvas of={Stories.WithSubtitle} />

## Avatar sizes

You can define a specific size for the avatar block in the same way it's defined for the `Avatar` component.

<Canvas of={Stories.AvatarSizes} />

## Avatar color schemes

You can define a specific color scheme for the avatar block in the same way it's defined for the `Avatar` component.
This should be useful when you have to display many different users and differentiate them.

These are only three examples of this variant:

<Canvas of={Stories.AvatarColorSchemes} />
