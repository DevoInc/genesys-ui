# Stepper

The purpose of the Stepper component is to provide a visual representation of a
multistep process.

The component can display the status of each step, indicating whether it is
completed, in progress, or disabled, and allows the user to navigate between
steps using buttons.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { Stepper } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';`} />

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Navigation between steps

More complex usage of the Stepper component, where the state of the steps is
managed by the parent component.
It demonstrates how to handle navigation between steps.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithNavigation} />

## Advanced usage

If we need a customization, or simply we want to use a specific piece of the
component we have its internal components available following dot notation.

- `Stepper._Container`: the outermost container which distributes the items.
- `Stepper._Item`: each item for each step of the process.

We don't recommend this usage, but anyway it's available for very specific
needs, usually because we need custom styles for some piece of the component.
