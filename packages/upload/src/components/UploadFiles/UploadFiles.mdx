# UploadFiles

and some of its plugins. However, not all of its properties are can use
inside UploadFiles component.

## How to import

<Source code={`import { UploadFiles } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui-upload';`} />

## Basic usage

Basic example allowing upload multiple files.

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Status

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

## Custom files extension

To specify the extension file allowed to upload you should use
`acceptedExtensions` property.

This property must be an array with the extension files allowed.

_Note_: note that the extensions _must_ have the dot at the beginning.

## Custom files size

To limit the size of the files to be uploaded there exist following properties: `minFileSize`,
`maxFileSize` and `maxTotalFileSize`. They are based on
[File size validation](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/file-validate-size/)
plugin.
