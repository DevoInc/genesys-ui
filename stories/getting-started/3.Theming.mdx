# Theming

For theming we are using the [styled-component](https://styled-components.com/)
[ThemeProvider](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider) so, any
use of our components should be wrapped on the _ThemeProvider_

<Source code={`
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { light } from '@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={light}>
    ...
  </ThemeProvider>
);
`} />

Here, in the example, you could see that we are using _light_ from
_genesy-brand-devo_ as the theme for our application, you could see how these
theme is structured in the
[genesys-tokens](https://github.com/DevoInc/genesys-tokens) project, there is
also a list of all the tokens generated in this theme in the
[page of the project](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-tokens/), you could also
read about how to create your own [here](TODO).
