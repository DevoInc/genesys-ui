# Integrating genesys-ui into a React project

This guide provides instructions for integrating the `genesys-ui` library into a _React_ project that uses [styled-component](https://styled-components.com/).
Since `genesys-ui` requires a theme to be provided, this document also covers how to add a brand to your project.

As an alternative to this guide, [genesys-ui-demo-app](https://github.com/DevoInc/genesys-ui-demo-app) package provides a working
app that includes all the steps described in this guide, and which can be used as a template for your own project.

## Installing genesys-ui into your application

`genesys-ui` is the core package that contains all the base components.
It is a peer dependency of all the other packages in the `genesys-ui` family.

Install genesys-ui core using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-ui
```

Depending on your specific needs you might also need to install one or more of the following packages:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-ui-datetime
...
```

Visit [Overview](/docs/getting-started-overview--docs) for a description of the available packages.

## Adding required base styles

Genesys-ui components rely on a set of base styles that are provided by the [@devoinc/genesys-base-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devoinc/genesys-base-styles) package
and are required for the components to work properly.

To add these styles to your project, install `@devoinc/genesys-base-styles` using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-base-styles
```

In the entry point of your app (e.g., index.js(x), index.ts(x), main.js(x), or main.ts(x)), import the following CSS stylesheet:

```ts
import '@devoinc/genesys-base-styles/dist/styles.css';
```

This stylesheet provides a set of default styles, including a CSS reset and font definitions.

## Adding a theme

Genesys-ui requires a theme to be provided to the components.
This theme is a set of key-values, also known as tokens, that define the appearance of the components.
In the `genesys-ui` ecosystem, these tokens are defined in a brand package, and are W3CDTCG-compliant©™.
See [W3C Design Tokens Format Module](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/) for more information.

The default brand for Devo's users is [@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo](https://github.com/DevoInc/genesys-brand-devo).

To add the Devo's brand to your project, install _@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo_, using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-brand-devo
```

If you require a custom theme, you can also create your own brand package using the `genesys-tokens` toolkit. For more information, visit [@devoinc/genesys-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devoinc/genesys-tokens).

Once the theme is installed, you can add it to your project by wrapping your app with the [ThemeProvider](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider) component provided by _styled-components_:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { light, dark } from '@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={light}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

`genesys-brand-devo` provides both a light and a dark schema. You can choose the one that best fits your needs, or toggle between them based on your app's requirements.
An example of the available tokens and their values can be found in [@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-brand-devo/).

## Making styled-components aware of the theme's scheme

If you need to work with styled components on your application, you can make them aware of your theme's structure by using module augmentation. To do so:

- Create a `styled.d.ts` file in `src/`.
- Add the following code to the file:

  ```ts
  import 'styled-components';
  import { Brand } from '@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo';

  declare module 'styled-components' {
    export interface DefaultTheme extends Brand {}
  }
  ```

This code augments the _DefaultTheme_ interface provided by _styled-components_ with our tokens schema (_Brand_ interface), which is defined in the _@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo_ package.
