# Integrating genesys-ui into a React project

This guide provides instructions for integrating the `genesys-ui` library into a _React_ project that uses `styled-components`. It also covers how to add a custom brand to your project.

As an alternative, you can use the `genesys-ui-demo-app` package, which includes a working app that implements the steps described in this guide.

## Installing Genesys-ui into your application

Install genesys-ui core using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-ui
```

Depending on your specific needs you might also need to install one or more of the following packages:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-ui-form
npm i @devoinc/genesys-ui-datetime
```

Visit [Overview](/docs/getting-started-overview--docs) for a description of the different packages.

## Adding required base styles

Genesys-ui components rely on a set of base styles to ensure a consistent look and feel across your application. To add these styles to your project, install @devoinc/genesys-base-styles using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-base-styles
```

In the entry point of your app (e.g., index.js(x), index.ts(x), main.js(x), or main.ts(x)), import the following _genesys-base-styles_ CSS stylesheet:

```ts
import '@devoinc/genesys-base-styles/dist/styles.css';
```

This stylesheet provides a set of default styles that help ensure a consistent look and feel across your application.

## Adding support for icons

Some Genesys-ui components rely on an icon font to display icons. To add this font to your project, install @devoinc/genesys-icons using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-icons
```

Although some components in _genesys-ui_ are in the process of being updated to remove the need for an icon font, some still rely on it. To import the icon font, add the following import statement right below the _genesys-base-styles_ import:

```ts
import '@devoinc/genesys-icons/dist/gi-styles.css';
```

This imports the necessary requirements to display the icons in genesys-ui.

A template for a React project that uses styled-components and includes the above steps is available in the `genesys-ui-demo-app` package.

## Adding a theme

Genesys-ui requires a theme to be provided.
This theme is a set of key-values, also known as tokens, that define the appearance of the components.

These tokens are defined in a brand package. To add the Devo's brand to your project,
install _@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo_, using npm:

```bash
npm i @devoinc/genesys-brand-devo
```

You can also create your own brand package. For more information, see [@devoinc/genesys-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devoinc/genesys-tokens).

Once the theme is installed, you can add it to your project by wrapping your app with the _ThemeProvider_ component provided by _styled-components_:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import brand from '@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={brand.light}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

## Making styled-components aware of the theme's schema

If you need to work with styled components on your application, you can make them aware of your theme by using module augmentation. To do so:

- Create a `styled.d.ts` file in `src/`.

- Add the following code to the file:

  ```ts
  import 'styled-components';
  import { Brand } from '@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo';

  declare module 'styled-components' {
    export interface DefaultTheme extends Brand {}
  }
  ```

This code augments the _DefaultTheme_ interface provided by _styled-components_ with our tokens schema (_Brand_ interface), which is defined in the _@devoinc/genesys-brand-devo_ package.

With these steps, you should be able to use genesys-ui components and styles in your React project with styled-components and a custom brand. All the above is exemplified in [genesys-ui-demo-app](https://github.com/DevoInc/genesys-ui-demo-app).
