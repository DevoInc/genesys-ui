# Genesys UI

Genesys UI is a library of React UI components that implements [Genesys Design System](https://devoinc.github.io/genesys-design-system/?path=/docs/home--docs) Guidelines. It is written in Typescript, and it uses [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling.

It is a collection of components that can be used to build React applications.
Genesys UI is designed to be flexible, consistent, and accessible.

## Demo App

<div
  style={{
    borderRadius: '0.4rem',
    border: 'solid 0.1rem #eee',
    padding: '0.8rem',
    marginTop: '3.2rem',
  }}
>
  <img src="./images/components-preview.png" alt="components preview" />
</div>
