# Consuming the library

Importing the `genesys-ui` package into your project will give you access to all of the components and utilities that are available in the library.

Using a component is as simple as adding the import, and using it in your code.

```jsx
// MyView.tsx

import { Flex, Typography, Avatar } from '@devoinc/genesys-ui';

export const MyView: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Flex flexDirection='column' gap='cmp-xxl' justifyContent='center'>
      <Typography.Heading size='h1'>
        Welcome to <Typography.CodeInline>genesys-ui</Typography.CodeInline>
      </Typography.Heading>
      <Avatar
        size='xxl'
        name='Rick Sanchez'
        variant='circle'
        imageSrc='https://i.pravatar.cc/300'
      />
    </Flex>
  );
};
```

**Note:** If you happen to run into styles inconsistencies, make sure that you have gone through the [Installation](/docs/getting-started-installation--docs) steps.

# Building the layout of a vertical app

Genesys-ui provides the required components to build the layout of a vertical app. To learn how to build the scaffolding of a vertical app that can be seamlessly integrated into the web app we recommend using the `genesys-ui-demo-app` package as a starting point for your project.
It contains a comprehensive example that you can follow to create the required layout. The vertical app layout should start at the `<Grid.App>` (`App.tsx`) level and include all its children, which you can then customize to fit your needs.
